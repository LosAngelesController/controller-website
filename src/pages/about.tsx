            Kenneth Mejia is the 20th City Controller, elected in November 2022
            with 513,288 votes. Controller Mejia oversees a team of more than
            160 employees who conduct independent audits and investigations,
            manage the City’s accounting, payroll, and spending, report on the
            City’s finances, and provide transparency on City operations,
            policies, metrics, and data.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-black dark:text-gray-100 md:relative'>
            The City Controller is the elected paymaster, auditor and chief
            accounting officer for the City of Los Angeles. Along with the Mayor
            and City Attorney, the Controller is one of three offices elected
            every four years by citywide popular vote.
          </p>

          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-black dark:text-gray-100 md:relative'>
            In 1878, the position was created as the City Auditor, becoming an
            elected office in 1889. The 1925 City Charter changed the name of
            the position to City Controller. In 2000, a City Charter update
            granted the Controller the power to conduct performance audits of
            City departments, allowing an examination of departmental
            effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-black dark:text-gray-100 md:relative'>
            In order to fulfill the Controller’s Charter-mandated functions, the
            City Controller’s office has three major divisions – Audit Services,
            Accounting Operations, and Financial Reporting and Analysis – in
            addition to Executive Office and Management Services leadership and
            staff.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-black dark:text-gray-100 md:relative'>
            The Executive Office supports the Controller with staff dedicated to
            accountability and oversight, financial transparency, research,
            technology and innovation, government affairs, communications, and
            community engagement. Management Services is responsible for all
            aspects of personnel, departmental payroll, budgeting, accounting
            and facility management for the Controller’s office. Below is a
            closer look at Audit Services, Accounting Operations, and Financial

            The Audit Services Division of the Controller’s Office conducts
            scheduled audits, special audits, and audits requested by the City
            Council or City management. Audits determine if existing controls in
            City departments are adequate, gauge whether departments are
            operating efficiently and effectively, and ensure that revenues and
            expenditures are properly recorded in conformance with applicable
            laws and regulations. City auditors recommend improvements that
            promote efficiency and effectiveness of City operations and save

            Financial-related audits determine whether financial information is
            presented in accordance with established or stated criteria, and
            whether the internal control structure over financial reporting and
            safeguarding of assets is suitably designed and implemented to
            achieve its objectives. These audits also include routine payroll
            observations and reviews of departmental bank accounts.
          </p>
          <h3>Performance Audits</h3>
          <p className='mb-3 font-light text-black dark:text-gray-100 md:relative md:pb-8'>
            Performance and operational audits of City departments and programs
            are mandated by the City Charter, and assess whether government
            programs or functions are efficiently and effectively achieving
            their goals.
          </p>
          <h3>Special Analysis and Reviews</h3>

            These are different types of reports that do various things, such as
            tracking the implementation status of audit recommendations as
            asserted by management, follow-up audits to independently ensure
            implementation status, and other special assignments as directed. On
            an as-needed basis, the division also performs information systems
            audits, such as general control reviews, application reviews, and
            post-implementation systems reviews to ensure system functionality

            education and training programs.
