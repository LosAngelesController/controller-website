               As the Controller for the City of Los Angeles, our Office has the Charter responsibility to
prepare and publish the City’s Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) of the
City for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. I can report a year of strong revenue growth
that contributed to record reserves on July 1, the beginning of the current fiscal year.
                <br />
                <br />
                Unfortunately, it is also my responsibility to report the bad news: this year the City is
spending well beyond our actual revenues. Projected deficits for years to come will force
wrenching choices that threaten the vital services Angelenos rely on. This is not the result
of a sudden economic downturn, but the culmination of years of short-term budget
balancing at the cost of long-term fiscal sustainability.
                <br />
                <br />
               <b> Grim news requires serious long-term solutions for the future</b>
               <br/>
               
                
                <br />
                We’ve already seen the whiplash as the State of California has gone from a record-
breaking surplus to a projected huge deficit next fiscal year. While not as dependent on

volatile revenues as the State, the reality is that both the strong economic recovery from
the pandemic and major Federal emergency aid are behind us. Not only has revenue
growth slowed, it is falling far short of the optimistic projections contained in this year’s
adopted budget. Meanwhile, spending is exceeding expected levels. The estimates of the
City Administrative Officer contained in his recent January statement point to a budget
shortfall in excess of $143 million to be addressed by a partial hiring freeze and tapping
the City’s Reserve Fund. The shortfall could swell to as much as $400 million next year,
according to the CAO.
                <br />
                <br />
                Even as we look back on the positive results from the prior year, the warning signs were
there:
<ul>
  <li>As previously reported, despite widespread staff vacancies, General Fund
departmental spending actually exceeded last year’s adopted budget by nearly $200
million. Had the vacancy rate been closer to normal, the budget would have been in
the red.</li>
<li>As our Office has consistently pointed out, citywide deferred maintenance of vital
infrastructure requires urgent attention. Last year’s underspending of $316 million in
budgeted capital expenditures underscores that the City continues to fall behind –
which means even higher costs in the long run.</li>
<br></br>
<li>Again, as we have warned, current staff shortages and long-term underinvestment
in the training, technology, equipment and facilities for our workforce hobbles
productivity and shortchanges our residents. The homelessness crisis and the reality
of a changing climate put even further strain on City resources.</li>
</ul>
                <br />
                <br />The contract for rank-and-file police staff ratified last fall will add nearly a billion dollars in
additional costs over the next four years, with the likelihood of commensurate increases
in compensation for police management. The new five-year contracts negotiated with
civilian bargaining units will have an even larger budget impact, putting budget projections
deeply in the red for the next five years.
                <br />
                <br />Without a long-term approach to putting our fiscal house in order, short-term decisions
will doom Los Angeles to an inexorable decline in public services, undermining our quality
of life and the economic prospects of our residents.
                <br />
                <br />Nothing short of a serious, strategic five-year plan to fix our City’s finances can meet this
moment. Scrambling every year to paper over budget gaps will result in ever-worsening
political pain and economic hardships.
                <br />
                <br />A transition to a two-year budget cycle would save enormous staff time, give greater
opportunity for meaningful community participation, and allow for a more strategic
approach to the City’s Finances. The City also needs a transparent Capital Improvement
Program beyond the current wish list of billions of dollars in unfunded projects.
Participatory budgeting, expanded beyond its current experimental pilot, would offer
greater citizen engagement in the City’s fiscal health.
<br />The City should also break with the opaque process where annual departmental budgets

are simply marginally adjusted (up or down) without fundamentally altering the long-
standing budgetary status quo. Given the daunting financial realities, the City needs to

undertake a strategic reallocation of resources to what matters most to the long-term
wellbeing of all of our residents. Budgets are not just numbers; they are a statement of
values. As our city changes, so should our financial priorities.
                <br />
                <br />Our Office is eager to collaborate with the Mayor, Council, and greater community to
reform the City’s budgeting process and priorities. This must be a long-term commitment
because the problems are long-standing and will require a phased approach to solving.
Budget reform and more accountable stewardship of the public’s resources are vital to
minimize abrupt service cuts (which disproportionately hurt our most vulnerable) –
especially if economic conditions deteriorate.
                <br />
                <br />Los Angeles is a vibrant, dynamic center of one of the world’s most diverse and influential
regions. Our City has the potential to restore fiscal health, improve vital City services, and
lead the world in confronting climate change, housing insecurity, and a changing
economy. It would be tragically short-sighted not to tackle the City’s fiscal challenges to
capture that potential. We must put our City on the path to fiscal sustainability so we can
do the job our residents expect us to do.
                <br />
                <br />

            <p className='mt-2 lg:max-w-5xl'>
            The City and its surrounding metropolitan region feature incredible diversity in both 
            population and the economy. Tourism and hospitality, professional and business services,
             international trade, entertainment production, and wholesale trade and logistics all contribute 
             significantly to local employment. The Port of Los Angeles handles the largest volume of containerized
              cargo of all U.S. ports and ranks as number one in cargo value for U.S. waterborne foreign traffic.
               According to preliminary ACI statistics, in the calendar year 2022, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) 
               was the sixth busiest airport in the world in terms of total passengers and ninth busiest in terms of total
               cargo metric tons. According to the U.S. DOT originating and destination (O&D) Survey of Airline Passenger 
               Traffic for calendar year 2022, LAX had the largest number of domestic O&D passengers in the U.S. O&D passengers
                begin and end their journeys at LAX, while connecting passengers transfer to other flights at LAX.

              <p className="mt-2  lg:max-w-5xl">
                The post-pandemic economic recovery continued through fiscal
                year 2023 and resulted in robust General Fund revenue growth for
                the City. The strong revenues allowed the City to end fiscal
                year 2023 in a solid financial position, with a July 1, 2023
                Reserve Fund balance of $648.3 million, an all-time high.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2  lg:max-w-5xl">
                There are several economic factors that could impact revenues
                and the overall City’s fiscal position in the upcoming year.
                According to the University of California (UCLA) Anderson
                Forecast, while the California economy is growing faster than
                the U.S. economy, there is a risk that high interest rates might
                still disrupt the current expansion on the downside. Even though
                recession worries have subsided, increased military conflict
                abroad and a sense of greater geopolitical risk have kept
                uncertainty about the future high. The uncertainty factor,
                combined with a slower-growing U.S. economy in 2024, suggests a
                slower-growing California economy in 2024.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2  lg:max-w-5xl">
                The unemployment rate within the City of Los Angeles appears to
                be inching up as well. Although labor disputes involving
                SAG-AFTRA, Writers, and Longshore workers that consumed most of
                2023 have subsided, the Los Angeles Hotel workers' strike is
                still unsettled. According to the California Employment
                Development Department, the unemployment rate for the City of
                Los Angeles metro area rose from 4.6 percent in November 2022 to
                5.3 percent in November 2023.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-2  lg:max-w-5xl">
                Another factor is the higher mortgage interest rates, which
                continue to put downward pressure on real estate sales volume
                and prices. According to the California Association of Realtors’
                November 2023 Sales Report, although the median price was up by
                7.2 percent in Los Angeles, sales volume declined by 5.1 percent
                compared to November 2022. These economic factors contribute to
                downward economic pressures which could negatively affect the
                City’s economically sensitive revenue sources and the City’s
                financial position in 2024.

              The City operates under a Mayor-Council form of government. The
              Mayor supervises the administrative processes of the City and
              works with the City Council in matters relating to legislation,
              budget and finance. The 15-member City Council enacts ordinances,
              levies taxes, authorizes contracts and public improvements, adopts
              zoning and other land use contracts, and provides necessary
              resources for the budgetary departments and offices of the City.
              The City Controller and City Attorney are independently elected

            The City has established guidelines for the structure and management of the City’s debt, 
            which include target and ceiling levels for certain debt ratios to be used for financial 
            planning purposes and restrictions on the types of items that can be financed, limiting 
            financing only to those items with a useful life of six years or more. In accordance with this policy, 
            the ratio of annual debt payments cannot exceed 15% of General Fund revenues for voter-approved and non-voter 
            approved debt overall, and cannot exceed 6% of General Fund revenues for non-voter approved debt alone. The 6%
             ceiling for non-voter approved debt may be exceeded only if there is a guaranteed new revenue stream for the 
             debt payments and the additional debt will not cause the ratio to exceed 7.5%, or there is no guaranteed revenue
              stream but the 6% ceiling shall not be exceeded for more than one year.
