            Each year, in accordance with City Charter Section 311(c), my office submits a Revenue Forecast Report,
which includes information gathered from City departments, recent regional economic reports and
meetings with local economists. This report covers updated revenue estimates for the remainder of the
current fiscal year, ending June 30, 2024, and projections for fiscal year 2025. Forecasts inherently
involve uncertainty, however, our estimates of revenue for this year have proven to be more accurate
than the ones on which the adopted budget was ultimately based. Next year’s projections reflect our
best estimates and seeks to promote responsible budgeting in the fiscal year ahead. Also included in the
report are the estimated requirements for debt service and General Fund cash flow borrowing.

              <h2>Revenue</h2>
              <br />
              <h3>FY 2024 ESTIMATE</h3>
              The City’s adopted budget for fiscal year 2024, totals $13.1 billion. General Fund Revenues represent
60% of that ($7.90 billion), while the rest, close to $5.2 billion, comes from numerous special purpose
funds and available balances.
<br></br>
The Los Angeles County economy has overcome most of the challenges it faced during the COVID-19
pandemic. Following the recovery, population decline, housing supply and affordability, and poverty
have become the primary challenges. Predictions of a recession by the end of 2023 never
materialized—with a real possibility the county avoids a recession in favor of a modest, sustained
growth in the coming years. Our estimates for fiscal year 2023-24 were based on current trends.
<br></br>
We estimate that total General Fund revenue will be $7.7 billion (including the $136.4 million transfer
from the Reserve Fund), lower than the Budget by $160.0 million (2.0 percent), and exceeding the prior
fiscal year by $161.6 million or 2.1 percent.
              <br />
              <br />
              <h3>Lower Revenues, Higher Expenses force Emergency Action</h3>
              <p>
             <b>  Our last year’s report predicted “trouble ahead.” Unfortunately, that proved to be true.</b>In our March
2023 estimate, we projected revenues of $7.560 billion for the General Fund (GF). The City’s adopted
budget assumed GF revenues of $7.767 billion (not including transfers from the Reserve Fund). In the
CAO’s recent January financial report regarding fiscal concerns, they have estimated that the City’s
General Fund revenues are now $158 million below plan. Combined with some departments exceeding
their budget, the City has been forced to adopt an abrupt hiring freeze on filling all jobs except those
deemed “critical.” With double-digit vacancy rates across nearly every City department, a hiring freeze
will have a negative impact on virtually all City services.
              </p>
              <br />
           
              <h3>MEASURE ULA</h3>
              <p>
              Effective April 1, 2023, a new transfer tax, United to House LA (Measure ULA) was imposed on
residential and commercial real-property sales and transfers within the City of Los Angeles where the
consideration or value is greater than $5 million. The new tax, which is in addition to the current
transfer tax, imposes a 4.00% tax on real property sales or transfers at over $5 million but less than $10 
million, and a 5.5% tax on real property sales and transfers valued at $10 million or more. The City
generated $15.6 million ULA revenue in fiscal year 2022-23 and $156.9 million (as of January 2024) in
fiscal year 2023-24. Revenue generated by the new tax is intended to be used to fund affordable
housing and tenant assistance programs, including development, construction, acquisition,
rehabilitation, and operation of housing.
<br></br>
The future of ULA still remains unclear due to pending litigations and a November 2024 statewide ballot
measure that threatens to invalidate the Measure. Due to these uncertain outcomes and short history,
it is difficult for this Office to accurately forecast ULA revenue for fiscal year 2024-25. Based on
collection trend so far, our year-end estimate for 2023-24 is $270.3 million, $334.3 million or 55.3
percent below the $604.6 million in 2023-24 Adopted Budget. Our projection for 2024-25 is $271.1
million, 0.3 percent above 2023-24 estimate. My Office is urging the City to continue to responsibly
allocate ULA receipts, and to have a contingency plan in place to refund any collections already
expended in case the measure is invalidated.
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <h3>FY 2025 PROJECTION</h3>
              <p>
              The future remains uncertain, and it is difficult to predict the direction of the economy. The national
economy has so far experienced no recession over the past year, with inflation falling and a continuing
strong labor market. Interest rate hikes cooled the residential and commercial real estate markets. Our
local economy was dampened by a fall in overseas tourism and major strikes affecting the City’s
signature industry. <b>Looking ahead, we see some recovery but only an anemic 1.73% increase in
General Fund revenues over Fiscal 2023-24 projected actuals.</b> Our estimate of $7.738 billion in General
Fund revenue next year falls well short of the sharp rise in City expenses due to negotiated labor
agreements and other cost increases.
<br></br>
The largest revenue increase is projected to come from a 4.1% increase in Property Taxes ($83M
growth). Vehicle License Replacement fee is expected to grow by 5.4%, adding $34 million. Business
License and Parking Users’ taxes are also expected to outperform the overall average increase. On the
other hand, the Power Transfer, franchise payments and interest income are all expected to be lower in
the coming year for a net increase of just $132 million in GF revenue.
                <br />

            <p className='font-semibold'>
            Although we expect a slight growth for fiscal year 2025 based on current trends, should the national
economy fall into a recession within the next fiscal year, the City may realize less General Fund
revenue than we estimate, as most economically sensitive revenues would be impacted.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1>THE NEED FOR A LONG-TERM STRATEGY</h1>
            <p>
            General Fund expenses are on track to increase considerably next fiscal year. The State is experiencing
its own severe budget challenges. The Mayor’s ambitious effort to meet the homelessness emergency
will continue. Meanwhile, the hiring freeze will mean continued stress on both front-line and support
services from Animal Services to Public Works. The City still lacks a credible and comprehensive Capital
Improvement Plan to address its staggering backlog of deferred maintenance and the need to
modernize our aging infrastructure.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            All of this means that short-term fixes and budget gimmickry will only prolong pain and lead to “an
inexorable decline in public services, undermining our quality of life and the economic prospects of our
residents” as our Office warned in January when releasing the City’s Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report.
            </p>

            I summarized last year’s March Revenue Forecast with this advice: “The voters of Los Angeles expressed
their choices for change in the last election. It will be our shared responsibility not to be trapped by
business as usual if we are to deliver on their expectations. Taking the long view and the high road will
be essential to making a more equitable, livable and resilient city for our four million residents.”
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
            Our residents deserve to have their City’s fiscal house put in order so that not only their City
government lives within its means, but they can too. Our residents deserve to look forward to a brighter
future for themselves and their families based on a strong economy that leaves no one behind.
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
           <b>  Now is the time for City leadership to recognize the need to move beyond business as usual and get
down to the business of meeting the changing needs of our changing city.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
            </p>
            <h2>Debt</h2>
            <p>
            The estimated debt service requirement for 2024-25 on the City’s long-term debt is $549.8 million,
which is $22.8 million less than 2023-24 mainly due to decrease in General Obligation Bonds (GOB) total
payments ($109.5 million compared to $138.0 million in 2023-24). The $109.5 million payment is for
principal and interest payments on the City’s $1.2 billion in outstanding GOB. The remaining debt service
covers the Municipal Improvement Corporation of Los Angeles (MICLA), the Wastewater system, the
Solid Waste Resources Programs, and Site-Specific Tax Revenue Debt.
<br></br>
In total, debt service is projected to be 3.68 percent of projected 2024-25 General Fund receipts, well
under the 15 percent limit set by the City’s Debt Policy.
