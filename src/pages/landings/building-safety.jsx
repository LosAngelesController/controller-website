The VBA process includes declaring these properties a “Nuisance” and/or “Hazard” after a public hearing. When property owners fail to comply with orders requiring them to clean, secure, rehabilitate or demolish these buildings, VBA steps in and performs the physical abatement work of cleaning, securing, and if necessary, demolishing a building by way of an annually awarded contract to various private contractors.</li>
                <li className='mb-2'><b>FRP (Foreclosure Registry Program)</b>: VBA unit conducts inspection on sites that are registered through LAHD as foreclosed.</li>
                <li className='mb-2'><b>General</b>: Investigation of code violations in existing commercial buildings, hotels, motels, and single-family residential buildings</li>
                <li className='mb-2'><b>PACE (Pro-Active Code Enforcement)</b>: LADBS' PACE program is focused on specific code enforcement problems in limited geographic regions in the City.
