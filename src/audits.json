      "textofpage": "Cannabis regulation policies at the state and local levels have changed significantly in recent years. In 2017, following statewide legalization the previous year, Los Angeles voters overwhelmingly approved Measure M, which allowed the City to develop a licensing and regulatory framework for commercial cannabis activity in Los Angeles. The Department of Cannabis Regulation (DCR) and other City departments tasked with ensuring that Los Angeles does its part to uphold Measure M’s goals are the subject of this report.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe City’s policy stance towards cannabis has adapted over decades in response to changes in federal and State law and evolving voter preferences. From the enhanced criminal enforcement brought on by the War on Drugs to the City’s ban on most medical marijuana businesses under Proposition D (2013), cannabis possession and sales have largely been illegal until 2018.\n\nDespite these legal restrictions, the use of cannabis products remained prevalent. A 2015 Los Angeles County Department of Public Health survey found that 11.6% of adults in the county reported using marijuana in the past year. According to the 2015 survey, marijuana use was higher among younger adults, with 27.4% of respondents aged 18-to-20 reporting some use in the past year.\n\nA series of changes to State law, including the passage of Proposition 64 in 2016, allowed adults to legally use and possess cannabis and created a framework for legal commercial cannabis activities. As with alcohol and tobacco sales, the intent behind legalizing, regulating, and taxing commercial cannabis was to make it safer to use, mitigate its negative impacts, and raise tax revenue.\n\nFollowing the passage of Prop 64, Angelenos voted in 2017 to approve Measure M to allow and tax commercial cannabis activity in the City. The City created the Department of Cannabis Regulation (DCR) in 2017 to license and regulate commercial cannabis activities. Meanwhile, the Mayor’s Office formed the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce in 2019 to coordinate multi-departmental enforcement efforts to shut down unlicensed cannabis businesses. Finally, the Office of Finance (Finance) created dedicated units to manage the collection and auditing of cannabis taxes.\n\nThe legalization of cannabis businesses led to questions about how the City could best control, regulate, and tax commercial cannabis activity, and what it should do with the new tax revenue stream. More than four years after Measure M’s approval, the City is still in the process of answering those questions.\n\nThis report offers a review of the City’s cannabis efforts so far. Overall, we found that the City should do more to close down unlicensed cannabis businesses, refine tools to deter additional unlicensed businesses from entering the market, monitor licensed cannabis businesses for regulatory compliance, mitigate the risk of tax evasion by cannabis businesses, and proactively determine how cannabis business tax revenue should be spent.\n\nThe importance of rectifying the City’s oversight of commercial cannabis is critical to helping the nascent industry mature in ways that protect the health and safety of Angelenos.\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nThe City’s current oversight regime of commercial cannabis activity began in January 2018. Since then, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) reports that the number of known unlicensed cannabis businesses has decreased from 300 in 2018 to approximately 100 in June 2022. Though this reduction has been touted as a measure of progress, the actual number of unlicensed cannabis businesses is likely higher. The reported numbers for unlicensed cannabis businesses derive from complaints, service calls, and referrals that tend to focus on conspicuous entities like retail storefronts because illegal cultivation and manufacturing sites are more difficult to identify. DCR has also issued licenses to over 700 cannabis businesses. In addition, Finance has collected more than $320 million in cannabis business taxes and found an additional $31 million in additional cannabis tax liabilities through tax audits.\n\nDespite this progress, there is significant room for improvement on each of these fronts.\n\nThe City could do more to deter additional unlicensed cannabis businesses from opening – Current enforcement efforts have shown some success in closing unlicensed cannabis businesses. However, the enforcement tools currently being used may not be sufficiently aligned with Measure M’s intent to: (1) prevent additional unlicensed cannabis businesses from opening; and (2) discourage property owners from renting to these businesses.\nDCR has not monitored its licensees for regulatory compliance – Since 2018, DCR has received over 7,300 cannabis-related complaints, with over 5,000 complaints remaining unprocessed with no record of a review or investigation. These complaints include troubling allegations against licensed cannabis businesses, such as sales to minors, onsite cannabis consumption by employees, and unlicensed retail cannabis sales by a business licensed by DCR for non-retail activities. DCR has also failed to conduct periodic inspections at licensed cannabis businesses to monitor regulatory compliance. We visited six cannabis retail stores licensed by DCR and found a range of minor, moderate, and major violations at each of the storefronts.\nFinance has struggled to meet its goals to audit cannabis businesses – Finance has not been able to keep up with its goal of auditing every cannabis business every two years. As a result, Finance faces an increased risk that it will not be able to audit tax periods beyond the City’s three-year statute of limitations and recover some taxes owed to the City. In addition, Finance’s tax audits do not do enough to address the cash-heavy cannabis industry’s risk for tax evasion.\nThe City Could Proactively Determine How to Spend Cannabis Taxes – Although some General Fund allocations go towards cannabis-related items like enforcement, regulation, and administration, the City has not developed a plan or policy for how it will spend cannabis business taxes. Our review found various examples from other local jurisdictions that the City could emulate to spend cannabis tax revenue in ways that meet policymaker priorities and community needs.\nWHAT WE RECOMMEND\n\nThe City should take additional steps to deter unlicensed cannabis businesses from operating in Los Angeles, begin monitoring licensed cannabis businesses for regulatory compliance, more effectively audit cannabis businesses to mitigate tax evasion, and proactively determine how to spend cannabis business tax dollars.\n\nSpecifically, the City should:\n\nexpand its enforcement strategy to put more pressure on property owners to shut down and deter unlicensed cannabis businesses from operating by applying several unused enforcement methods;\ndevelop and implement a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan to monitor licensed cannabis businesses and enforce its rules and regulations;\nrevise its cannabis license and application fees to include the cost of carrying out its regulatory compliance plan;\nreconsider its goal to audit every cannabis business every two years, and expand its efforts to address potential tax evasion by cannabis businesses; and\ndevelop and adopt spending plan for cannabis tax revenue to align with spending priorities.\nBACKGROUND\n\nCalifornia and Los Angeles have a long history of trying to regulate cannabis. Although the federal government recently announced that it is undergoing a policy review, under current federal and State law, cannabis is categorized as a Schedule I substance, defined as “drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.” Governmental policy at the federal, state, and local level, starting especially with the War on Drugs in the 1970s, resulted in decades of enhanced criminal enforcement.\n\nThe State’s policy towards cannabis shifted with the passage of Proposition 215 in 1996. Prop 215 modified State law to allow patients and primary caregivers to obtain marijuana for medical purposes without being subject to criminal prosecution by the State. However, Prop 215 lacked a formal regulatory framework to ensure that marijuana was only used for medical purposes. This unregulated environment allowed hundreds of marijuana dispensaries to open in Los Angeles and throughout the State.\n\nIn response, the City enacted ordinances to control these dispensaries, culminating in the passage of Proposition D in 2013. Approximately 135 dispensaries were given limited immunity from enforcement, while all other marijuana businesses were banned. Subsequently, the City Attorney’s Office initiated over 1,700 criminal filings through November 2016.\n\nA series of changes to State law, including the passage of Proposition 64 in November 2016, changed the State’s policy once again. Otherwise known as the “Control, Regulate, and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act,” Prop 64 legalized the possession and personal use of cannabis for adults aged 21 and over, and reduced criminal penalties for various other marijuana-related offenses from felonies to misdemeanors or infractions. The State also began taxing commercial cannabis activity. To regulate cannabis, Prop 64 created a dual-track system where cannabis businesses are licensed and regulated by both the State and local jurisdictions that choose to allow commercial cannabis activity.\n\nCalifornia is still a patchwork of areas where it is and is not legal to establish a cannabis business. According to the California Department of Cannabis Control, as of February 2022, 235 (44%) of the 539 cities and counties in the State allow at least one type of cannabis business, while 56% do not allow any kind at all.\n\nFollowing this shift in State policy, Angelenos overwhelmingly approved Measure M in March 2017. The approved ballot ordinance allowed the City to develop a licensing framework to authorize and regulate cannabis businesses, and established taxes for commercial cannabis activity that went into effect on January 1, 2018. To prevent unlicensed cannabis businesses from opening and to discourage property owners from renting to these businesses, Measure M also established several enforcement mechanisms, including criminal penalties, utility disconnects, and a maximum civil penalty of $20,000 for each day of violation.\n\nIn 2017, the City established the Department of Cannabis Regulation (DCR) to regulate legal cannabis businesses within Los Angeles. As part of its regulatory duties, DCR is responsible for licensing commercial cannabis activities, developing rules and regulations to implement local and State laws, and monitoring and enforcing licensee compliance. Working with DCR is the Cannabis Regulation Commission, a five-member commission tasked with recommending and implementing the City’s laws and regulations pertaining to cannabis-related activity.\n\nThroughout establishing a regulatory structure, the City Council also recognized the importance of mitigating the impact of commercial cannabis and connecting it to social policy goals. This led to the creation of a Social Equity Program to give priority licensing to individuals and communities that were disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs. However, other concerns exist, such as increased cannabis use among youth and quality-of-life issues for communities near cannabis businesses. As a result, there is still an ongoing debate on how the City can enhance enforcement, improve regulation and administration, and advance social policy goals connected with commercial cannabis.\n\nTo better regulate the cannabis market environment and increase cannabis tax revenues, this report provides findings and recommendations to improve the City’s enforcement, regulation, and taxation of cannabis businesses. In addition, this report also provides policy options and considerations for spending cannabis tax revenues.\n\nENFORCEMENT AGAINST UNLICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES\n\nThe need to regulate commercial cannabis activity was driven, in part, by a recognition that the proliferation of unregulated cannabis businesses led to increased crime and negative secondary impacts that needed to be managed and controlled. After the passage of Measure M, the City Council adopted an ordinance limiting the number of licensed retail cannabis storefronts. With that limitation in mind, unlicensed businesses could either stop their operations and apply with DCR in hopes of getting a license or continue selling cannabis and face the risk of enforcement.\n\nDespite establishing a licensing framework and continued enforcement by the City, crime and other adverse impacts persist, as many unlicensed cannabis businesses have chosen to continue operating.\n\nConcerns with Unlicensed Cannabis Businesses\n\nUnlicensed cannabis businesses are associated with a host of public health issues. For example, a 2021 study by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health found that unlicensed dispensaries were less likely than licensed businesses to engage in business practices that restrict youth access, such as identification checks. In addition, unlicensed cannabis businesses were more likely to engage in business practices such as offering free samples, selling illegal high-potency products, and allowing onsite consumption.\n\nFurther, unlike products sold through licensed channels, cannabis products sold in unlicensed dispensaries may not be tested for contaminants (like pesticides or processing chemicals) or properly labeled. This lack of testing may have been a factor in the 2019 outbreak of lung illness, mainly among users of unregulated cannabis vaping products.\n\nIn addition to being a crime, unlicensed commercial cannabis activities also create issues for public safety. Because cannabis sales remain a federal crime, transactions are often conducted in cash, making dispensaries the target of robberies and other crimes. As a result, it is not uncommon for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) to find firearms at unlicensed businesses. In one instance, an 18-year-old customer was shot and killed in 2019 at an unlicensed cannabis dispensary in Chatsworth by alleged gang members working there.\n\nPublic safety issues associated with unregulated cannabis are not limited to dispensaries. In November 2021, LAPD and other City departments investigated an industrial warehouse being used as an illegal cannabis grow operation. Investigators discovered several code violations, including dangerous wiring, a gas leak, and hazardous fumes from a large diesel generator, which could have caused an explosion and fire at the location.\n\nAnother concern is that unlicensed businesses operate with an unfair market advantage. Applicants for a DCR cannabis license must pay at least $14,000 in fees that are expected to increase further as the City begins implementing the State’s annual licensing requirements. There are also additional regulatory costs, including licensing fees paid to the State, and fees for permits and inspections to other local agencies to maintain compliance.\n\nLicensed cannabis businesses also collect and pay taxes, which can be a substantial portion of the final cost to consumers. Built into the retail price of cannabis products sold by licensed businesses are State and local taxes at the cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution phases of the production chain. Further, more taxes are added as part of a retail transaction and include:\n\n15% State excise tax on the wholesale market price;\n10% Los Angeles City cannabis business tax for adult-use sales; and\n5% retail sales tax on all tangible retail products in Los Angeles.\n\nUnlicensed businesses do not face these costs, allowing them to undercut licensed businesses on price. One industry analyst estimated that spending in the State’s unlicensed market topped $8.7 billion in 2019, nearly three times the spend ($3.1B) in the legal market. Every sale in the unlicensed market is potentially a loss of tax revenue for the City.\n\nCannabis Enforcement Taskforce: Department Roles and Responsibilities\n\nIn 2019, the Mayor’s Office formed the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce to coordinate enforcement efforts and shut down unlicensed cannabis businesses. The taskforce is headed by the Mayor’s Office of Public Safety, while LAPD plays a lead role in investigating and coordinating enforcement actions among several other departments. In addition, the City Attorney’s Office takes referrals from the departments and prosecutes cases as criminal or civil matters.\n\nAlthough the City may know about an unlicensed cannabis business, LAPD will not always investigate it. LAPD’s 2018 cannabis enforcement guidelines direct their Narcotics Enforcement Details (NEDs) to focus enforcement activities at unlicensed cannabis businesses that also involve “significant criminal activity” or complaints of illicit activity. The commanding officer at each of LAPD’s 21 geographic divisions is responsible for defining what constitutes “significant criminal activity” relative to cannabis enforcement and setting priorities for their division. Unlicensed cannabis businesses that only involve a failure to obtain a license for the activity taking place are deferred to DCR.\n\nFollowing an investigation, the taskforce departments follow a progressive enforcement approach to close down the unlicensed cannabis business. Enforcement begins with a cease-and-desist letter to the business and the property owner to try and obtain voluntary compliance before moving on to stronger methods. Most other enforcement actions center around LAPD’s criminal search warrants.\n\nWhile executing a search warrant, LAPD will investigate the unlicensed cannabis business for evidence of a crime, make arrests, and seize contraband (such as cannabis products, currency, and firearms). If other departments are also participating in the enforcement effort, LAPD will secure the building so that other departments can perform their enforcement actions, including utility disconnects and code inspections.\n\nWhile onsite during a search warrant, LADBS and LAFD inspectors focus on finding building and fire code violations, especially those that present a health and safety concern to the building’s occupants at unlicensed cannabis businesses. These dangerous code violations often include unpermitted construction, electrical work, and concealed or blocked building exits. LADBS will issue an Order to Comply to the property owner to address the code violations. LADBS will refer the case to the City Attorney’s Office for misdemeanor prosecution if the property owner does not cooperate. LAFD also refers all of its cases for prosecution.\n\nSince 2018, the City has taken many enforcement actions against unlicensed cannabis businesses, as shown in Table 2. However, the need for a stronger deterrent resulted in a 2021 ordinance that allows LADBS to install protective devices around the property to try and keep the property closed.\n\nAfter exhausting other enforcement methods, including numerous search warrants, the Taskforce may instruct LADBS to work with a contractor to install protective devices such as padlocks, barricades, and fencing to prevent the unlicensed cannabis business from reopening. After the location is locked down, an LAPD NED investigator will provide access to the property owner to remove all property used by the unlicensed cannabis business and to address building and fire code violations.\n\nAfter conducting criminal search warrants, LAPD refers misdemeanor cases of unlicensed commercial cannabis violations to the City Attorney’s Cannabis Abatement and Prosecution Section. The City Attorney’s Office can prosecute business owners, employees, and property owners for the operation of an unlicensed cannabis business, either as a misdemeanor crime or a public nuisance to be abated through civil litigation.\n\nThe City Attorney’s Office prosecutes criminal and civil cases against unlicensed cannabis businesses in the name of the people of the State of California, and not on behalf of the City. When the City Attorney’s Office prosecutes cases in the name of the people, including when it chooses to prosecute civil abatement cases in this manner, the City is not the City Attorney’s client, and other City Officials (including the Council) cannot provide direction or otherwise interfere with the City Attorney’s discretion in how they choose to dispose of cases.\n\nPersons found guilty of a misdemeanor can be subject to criminal fines of up to $1,000 and/or up to six months in jail. The City Attorney’s Office may also file civil litigation for a number of related violations and pursue remedies that include a civil penalty of up to $20,000 for each day the unlicensed cannabis business is in operation. According to the City Attorney’s Office, from January 2018 through June 2022, they have filed over 800 misdemeanor criminal cases and eight civil complaints as part of their enforcement efforts to stop unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nREGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF LICENSED CANNABIS BUSINESSES\n\nDCR’s struggles with application and license processing have been the subject of much public scrutiny and Council oversight. For example, the Council adopted new application processing requirements and timelines for DCR that went into effect at the start of our audit. DCR also faces upcoming State-imposed deadlines to move away from its current temporary licensing process and implement the State’s annual licensing requirements. Because these issues are still being addressed, we opted to focus instead on DCR’s role as a regulator for the cannabis businesses it has already licensed.\n\nIn addition to administering the application, licensing, and renewal process, DCR’s Licensing, Compliance, and Commission Support Unit is responsible for investigating complaints and monitoring compliance of licensed cannabis businesses. From 2018 through October 2022, DCR issued temporary license approvals to over 700 cannabis businesses covering more than 1,300 licensed activities.\n\nSeparately, DCR has received over 7,300 complaints through its online complaint portal. These complaints include reports of potential unlicensed cannabis businesses, concerns about business practices at licensed cannabis businesses, and quality-of-life issues related to cannabis use in the City.\n\nADMINISTRATION OF THE CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX\n\nThe Office of Finance (Finance) is responsible for administering the City’s business tax, which is imposed for the privilege of engaging in business within City limits. In addition, every person engaged in business within Los Angeles must register with Finance, obtain a Business Tax Registration Certificate (BTRC), and post the BTRC at each business location.\n\nTo obtain or renew their license with DCR, all cannabis businesses must be current on any outstanding taxes due to the City. Like most other business activity in the City, commercial cannabis is taxed on gross receipts: the total amount charged or received for all sales and commissions. Unlike the federal or State business income tax, the City’s tax on gross receipts does not allow deductions for business expenses or most other costs. Further, gross receipts tax rates for commercial cannabis activity are much higher (between 1% and 10%) than other industries (between 0.10% and 0.425%).\n\nFinance established a cannabis cash collection unit to collect payments for cannabis business taxes and DCR’s application and license fees. Because commercial cannabis activity is still illegal under federal law, the industry faces difficulties obtaining banking and other financial services, making cannabis a cash-heavy industry. As a result, the cannabis cash collection unit accepts cash payments over $1,000 via appointment.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of tax evasion due to the industry’s cash-heavy nature, and ensure that cannabis businesses pay all taxes owed to the City, Finance also established a cannabis audit unit within its Audit Division. The cannabis audit unit consists of one senior tax auditor and four tax auditors who focus only on auditing tax payments from cannabis businesses. Finance’s goal is to audit every cannabis business every two years.\n\nCANNABIS-RELATED TAX REVENUES AND SPENDING\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, legal cannabis sales in the City are larger than in any other jurisdiction in the State. From January 2018 to June 2022, we estimate that the City received more than $36 million in sales tax revenue for the City’s General Fund from taxable retail cannabis sales.\n\nEven more significant was revenue from the City’s cannabis business tax, which showed substantial growth during its initial four years. Cannabis business taxes experienced year-over-year increase of more than 70% in both FY 2020 and FY 2021. From January 2018 to December 2021, the City collected more than $320 million in cannabis business taxes.\n\nHowever, cannabis business taxes have slowed in recent months. Cannabis business tax revenue is $51 million lower than budgeted FY 2022. This slowdown in the City’s cannabis business tax revenues follows a similar pattern to the State’s cannabis tax revenues. The recent slowdown in cannabis business taxes may be caused by various factors, including recent inflation, peak in consumption, and competition with the unlicensed market.\n\nCurrently, cannabis business taxes go to the General Fund and are spent on general City services. However, the Council has expressed several policy preferences on how the City should spend cannabis taxes to benefit those affected by cannabis, including support for social equity or to fund public works projects for communities near cannabis businesses. To protect cannabis tax revenue and raise funding to allocate towards policymaker priorities, the City will need to shut down more unlicensed cannabis businesses and steer consumers to licensed cannabis businesses.\n\nEXPANDING ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES\n\nThe City’s past experience with illegal cannabis activities and its negative impacts, including increased criminal activity, sales to minors, and urban blight, highlight the need for effective regulation and enforcement. To that end, Measure M provided the City with enforcement tools to shut down existing unlicensed cannabis businesses, and discourage operators and property owners from engaging in or allowing illegal commercial cannabis activities.\n\nThrough the combined efforts of the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce and the City Attorney’s Office, LAPD’s monthly report of active unlicensed cannabis businesses has decreased from 297 in 2018 to 106 as of June 2022. While this decrease in reported unlicensed cannabis businesses has been touted as a measure of progress for the City, it has its limitations.\n\nThe total number of known unlicensed cannabis businesses comes from complaints, service calls, and referrals received by the City, and businesses identified by each of LAPD’s 21 geographic divisions. LAPD acknowledges that its report tends to focus on more conspicuous types of cannabis businesses like retail storefronts because illegal cultivation and manufacturing sites are more difficult to identify. The actual number of unlicensed cannabis businesses in the City is likely higher than reported.\n\nDespite these limitations in identifying unlicensed cannabis businesses, the total number has not changed significantly and has remained at or around 100 over the last two years. For the purposes of this report, LAPD could not provide the names and locations of unlicensed cannabis businesses that were the subject of enforcement actions, which they say are not stored centrally. However, month-to-month changes in LAPD’s report suggest that unlicensed cannabis businesses continue to open almost as quickly as the City can shut them down.\n\nAs described below, the City’s criminal enforcement of unlicensed cannabis violations is an important tool. But it has difficulties deterring more businesses from engaging in unlicensed commercial cannabis activities. Meanwhile, other enforcement methods used by the Taskforce can be effective but are no easy fix. To make more headway, the City should consider adopting additional enforcement tools to continue putting pressure on property owners and unlicensed cannabis businesses to shut down.\n\nCRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT’S ABILITY TO DISCOURAGE UNLICENSED CANNABIS IS LIMITED\n\nWhile traditional law enforcement approaches seek to deter crime with the threat or act of punishment, subject matter experts have questioned that method of operation. For example, in a 2016 paper, the National Institute of Justice (the US Department of Justice’s research agency) summarized a large body of research on criminal deterrence and asserted that “increasing the severity of punishment does little to deter crime” and that “sending an individual convicted of a crime to prison is not a very effective way to deter crime.”\n\nThis change in thinking has manifested into a variety of criminal justice reforms in recent years. For example, Proposition 47 (2014) reclassified a variety of “nonserious” and “nonviolent” crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies, resulting in reduced criminal penalties. Similarly, the authors behind Prop 64 viewed many drug offenses, such as marijuana sales, as nonviolent, and sought to reduce criminal penalties to match the “minor” nature of the crime.\n\nIf tougher punishments held any power to deter crimes from happening, Prop 64’s reduction in criminal penalties for a variety of marijuana-related offenses means that traditional law enforcement methods are less likely to prevent unlicensed cannabis businesses from opening. Nevertheless, the City is still dedicating a significant portion of its enforcement resources towards criminal enforcement methods like criminal search warrants and criminal prosecution.\n\nCriminal Search Warrants\n\nWhen executing a search warrant, LAPD will search all employees and other personnel on-site (often resulting in arrests) and seize all cannabis products, currency, firearms, and any other property that could constitute evidence showing that the crime of operating an unlicensed cannabis business has occurred.\n\nHowever, search warrants are costly to execute. Due to the number of sworn officers and time involved, LAPD estimates that each search warrant in FY 2022 for unlicensed cannabis costs about $15,800 in straight time to conduct. But LAPD’s Narcotics Enforcement Details have multiple priorities besides unlicensed cannabis enforcement. According to LAPD, most search warrants are conducted by sworn LAPD officers on overtime, increasing the cost of unlicensed cannabis enforcement.\n\nAlthough making arrests and seizing contraband can make it more difficult for unlicensed cannabis businesses to operate, LAPD notes that the most persistent operators will quickly reopen. Enforcement against unlicensed cannabis is a significant drain on public resources as LAPD has executed more than 1,200 search warrants between 2018 and 2021. According to LAPD, some unlicensed cannabis business locations will reopen within days or even hours after a search warrant is executed, and will likely be the site of more search warrants.\n\nCriminal Litigation\n\nFollowing the execution of criminal search warrants, LAPD will refer misdemeanor cases to the City Attorney’s Office for prosecution. Under the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), operating, working at, or renting property to an unlicensed cannabis business is classified as a misdemeanor. Those convicted can be punished with up to six months of jail time and/or up to $1,000 in criminal fines.\n\nFrom January 2018 through June 2022, the City Attorney’s Office has exercised its prosecutorial discretion to file 863 criminal complaints as part of its enforcement efforts against unlicensed commercial cannabis activities. Available data from the City Attorney’s Office showed that 83% (548) of the 654 criminal cases filed in 2020 and 2021 with a disposition as of February 2022 were either diverted from criminal prosecution or had their cases dismissed.\n\nAccording to the City Attorney’s Office, the number of court diversions is largely outside their control. State legislation (Assembly Bill 3234, 2020) authorizes Superior Court judges to divert a misdemeanor case from the proceeding with criminal prosecution, even over the objection of prosecuting attorneys. Cases are dismissed at the end of the court-determined diversion period if the defendant has complied with the judge’s terms, conditions, and programs deemed appropriate.\n\nThe City Attorney’s Office explained that while the courts will offer criminal diversion for unlicensed cannabis business violations, one of the terms and conditions of diversion is almost always a prohibition on engaging in further illegal commercial cannabis activity. In this way, the City Attorney’s Office reports that it still successfully closes unlicensed cannabis businesses, even while many cases are being diverted from further prosecution.\n\nThe actual penalties are often low for cases that result in a misdemeanor verdict or plea. The City Attorney’s Office stated that very few defendants for unlicensed cannabis violation cases have ever served jail time. The City Attorney’s Office also explained that for those who are sentenced with jail time, defendants often do not serve their entire sentence due to early release policies. If imposed by the court, misdemeanor fines that top out at $1,000 also do not represent a significant punishment for a commercial crime as profitable as unlicensed cannabis.\n\nEven if criminal penalties are not high, a criminal conviction alone may be enough for some types of defendants to avoid unlicensed cannabis violations. The City Attorney’s Office stated that criminal prosecution is a valuable tool in enforcement against property owners because they tend to be highly motivated to avoid or mitigate the damage of a criminal record. However, for those who regard a misdemeanor criminal record with little consequence, the outcomes of criminal enforcement are unlikely to deter them from participating in illicit commercial cannabis activity.\n\nTHE CITY’S OTHER ENFORCEMENT METHODS HAVE HAD MIXED RESULTS\n\nWhile a significant portion of the City’s enforcement resources is used for criminal enforcement methods, the City has also deployed other methods. These include code enforcement, civil litigation, utility disconnects, and installing protective devices to abate the unlicensed commercial cannabis activity. Though encouraging, these other enforcement methods are not always effective at deterring unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nBuilding and Fire Code Inspections\n\nAlthough LADBS and LAFD’s efforts are directed at the property owner, code enforcement does not currently address the unlicensed cannabis business at the root of the problem. During inspections, LADBS and LAFD focus on code violations related to the building structure and fire/life safety hazards. According to LADBS, their enforcement efforts typically do not note the unlicensed cannabis business activity that likely caused the code violations.\n\nCode enforcement also follows the misdemeanor prosecution route. LADBS explained that only about 20% of property owners at unlicensed cannabis businesses responded to the department’s initial Order to Comply to correct building code violations. After that, many cases are referred to the City Attorney’s Office for prosecution. LAFD’s route to criminal prosecution is even faster, as all fire code violations are packaged as a criminal referral. According to the City Attorney’s Office, criminal cases for code enforcement issues are only settled after the violations have been resolved.\n\nWhile criminal prosecution may be effective in resolving the specific code violations, it is unclear how effective they are for preventing or discouraging the unlicensed commercial cannabis activity that likely caused the violations.\n\nCivil Litigation\n\nMeasure M’s authors noted that it was necessary to have large monetary penalties to “prevent persons and entities from opening and operating…illegal…cannabis businesses and to discourage property owners from renting to these kind[s] of…cannabis businesses.” In addition, the authors of Measure M believed that “large monetary sanctions are a rational way to discourage the proliferation of illegal businesses.” Under Measure M, large monetary penalties can be obtained as a remedy through civil litigation in the form of a $20,000 maximum penalty for each day of violation.\n\nFrom 2018 through June 2022, the City Attorney’s Office filed eight civil complaints for the following alleged violations and requested remedies.\n\nHowever, the time and resources required to pursue civil litigation against unlicensed cannabis violators make it impractical as an enforcement tool in most cases. The City Attorney’s Office also clarified that civil courts tend toward settlement as opposed to trial. As a result, many civil cases against property owners reach a stipulated judgment that includes permanent injunctive terms barring unlicensed commercial cannabis activities on any of their properties, and deferred or substantially reduced civil penalties compared to the maximum that could be obtained through trial.\n\nFor example, in one civil case, the City Attorney’s Office collected over $41 million in default judgments, most of which comprised of the $20,000 per violation civil penalty applied to hundreds of violation days against the business operators. Meanwhile, the City Attorney’s Office settled with the property owners for $350,000 in civil penalties, and a permanent injunction preventing them from participating in or renting to any commercial cannabis activity in Los Angeles.\n\nFive of the eight civil cases filed have an outcome as of June 2022, with most cases requiring one to two years to reach a point of resolution. Where the City has been awarded default judgments because the defendant did not answer the lawsuit, the City Attorney’s Office explained that those judgments are often difficult to collect and require locating the violator and identifying their assets.\n\nThe time and resources required, and the realities of civil litigation as presented by the City Attorney’s Office, undercut Measure M’s premise that a large monetary penalty obtained through public nuisance abatement cases can be relied upon to deter unlicensed cannabis businesses from opening.\n\nUtility Disconnects and Installing Protective Devices\n\nIn early 2019, LADWP began disconnecting utilities at unlicensed cannabis business locations.  While the loss of power can significantly disrupt operations, anecdotally, LAPD estimates that half of unlicensed cannabis businesses that had their utilities disconnected have re-opened. These businesses have been known to rely on generators, steal or borrow power from their neighbors, or reconnect the power after being disconnected.\n\nInstalling protective devices (padlock, barricade, and fencing) on an unlicensed cannabis business can also be effective in some situations, but is not a foolproof method. LAPD also estimates that about half of padlocked unlicensed cannabis businesses re-open after removing the protective devices. We attempted to call each of the 17 locations that were padlocked between October 2021 and May 2022 and found three had re-opened while four more provided information about alternative locations.\n\nTHE CITY’S ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY COULD USE MORE TOOLS TO HOLD PROPERTY OWNERS ACCOUNTABLE\n\nWhile no single enforcement method can guarantee compliance, the City should consider using every tool at its disposal to shut down unlicensed cannabis businesses. Given the challenges with criminal enforcement and civil litigation, there are other methods that the City can use to both threaten and impose significant financial consequences as a way to discourage illegal cannabis businesses from opening in the first place.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of additional enforcement tools that the City could use to supplement its current approach. These tools would allow the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce to apply more pressure on property owners to ensure that unlicensed cannabis activity is not occurring on their property.\n\nIssuing Citations for Causing or Allowing Unlicensed Commercial Cannabis Activity\n\nThe City Council can authorize departments to enforce certain violations of the City’s code through the Administrative Citation Enforcement (ACE) program. ACE was designed as an alternative enforcement mechanism to: (1) deter code violations; and (2) reduce the amount of City resources used for enforcement, thereby freeing up City Attorney legal resources and court dockets for more serious violations and civil actions. In addition, issuing citations does not waive the City’s right to pursue criminal, civil, and other legal remedies.\n\nAs an alternative to criminal enforcement, the City Attorney’s Office has issued over 1,380 ACE citations to employees of unlicensed cannabis businesses who have no financial interest in the business. However, the ACE program can also be used to address violations involving unpermitted or unallowed uses of buildings, structures, or land.\n\nUnlicensed commercial cannabis activity is a clear example of unallowed land use. Under its well-established authority to control land use within Los Angeles, the City’s cannabis ordinances make it unlawful for property owners to rent, lease, or otherwise allow any commercial cannabis activity to occupy or use their building or land without a license from the State and DCR. In addition, commercial cannabis activity is not a permitted use in any zone, making unlicensed cannabis businesses a violation of the City’s Planning and Zoning code.\n\nTo cite property owners or other persons responsible for causing or allowing unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, the Council could authorize LADBS or another City department to issue ACE citations for unallowed land use. Although LADBS is granted the power to enforce the City’s zoning ordinances, the department views unlicensed commercial cannabis activities as a drug enforcement issue best handled by law enforcement. Regardless of which entity the Council designates as the issuing department for ACE citations, the associated fines for land use violations could be a large enough monetary penalty to discourage property owner from renting to unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nTable 7 demonstrates that, in some situations, an ACE fine for unpermitted use could exceed the City’s $20,000 per day maximum civil penalty for unlicensed cannabis violations. ACE fines would also be easier to issue when compared to the $20,000 per day maximum civil penalty that can only be obtained through court judgment after resource-intensive civil litigation.\n\nACE citations for unallowed land use are a continuing violation that must be corrected. The department issuing the ACE citation would have to provide property owners with a reasonable amount of time to stop the unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, and issue fines that accrue daily if left uncorrected. Continued noncompliance could result in substantial penalties for violators. Further, since cannabis-related activities are not a land use for which the City can issue a permit, violators can be subject to administrative fines of four times the normal amount set for land use violations.\n\nFor property owners concerned about the threat of significant monetary penalties, ACE citations are a readily available tool that the City could use. For example, the City of Santa Ana reported some success in using administrative fines in its fight against unlicensed cannabis businesses. Santa Ana code enforcement officers issued administrative citations and fines to property owners for $1,000, $2,500, and $5,000 for the 1st, 2nd, and subsequent violations for renting to unlicensed cannabis businesses. In describing its process, Santa Ana code enforcement officials emphasized the importance of maintaining pressure on the unlicensed cannabis business from multiple angles to obtain compliance.\n\nAs another example, Los Angeles County is in the process of implementing an administrative penalty geared specifically against unpermitted cannabis activities. In January 2022, the Board of Supervisors adopted a nuisance abatement ordinance allowing the County’s Department of Regional Planning to issue notices of violation and orders to abate unpermitted commercial cannabis activities. Mirroring penalties codified in State law, the Department of Regional Planning is also authorized to impose administrative penalties of up to $30,000 per day if the property owner does not cooperate to stop unpermitted cannabis activities on their property.\n\nTo move forward, departments participating in the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce, with the assistance of the City Attorney’s Office, should work together to determine how they can use ACE citations against property owners and other persons responsible for causing or allowing unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nPolicymakers should also consider updating the ACE program. In particular, the following changes should be made to meet current needs.\n\nUpdated fine amounts – Fines for unpermitted improvements and use have remained the same since ACE was enacted in 2013 and could be updated to match inflation. The original Council motion requested that fines be automatically updated to keep up with inflation, but this was ultimately left out of the ordinance enacting ACE.\nClear collection procedures – The ACE ordinance is not clear on how the City should collect unpaid fines. The LAMC could be updated with specific administrative procedures to allow the City to place uncollected ACE costs: (1) onto the County’s tax roll as a special assessment against the parcel of land; or (2) as a lien on the property where the unpermitted improvement or unpermitted use violation occurred. This could make it easier for the City to impose costs on property owners that lease to unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nFines for illegal cannabis cultivation – Recent State legislation (AB 2164, 2018) would allow the City to amend its ACE program to target illegal cannabis cultivation, as described below.\n\nWhile the Taskforce’s efforts are mainly focused on unlicensed dispensaries, illegal cannabis cultivation sites are also a concern in the City. Indoor cultivations often require a significant amount of power to operate, and could overload the system and pose a danger to the City’s electrical power infrastructure.\n\nTo combat this growing problem, the City could adopt an ordinance modifying its ACE program to allow for the immediate imposition of fines for violations that exist as a result of, or to facilitate, the illegal cultivation of cannabis. Under AB 2164, the City is only required to provide a reasonable period of time to correct the problem in certain situations.\n\nTo avoid the immediate imposition of fines, the property owner must demonstrate that: (1) the tenant is in possession of the property; (2) the lease agreement prohibits the cultivation of cannabis; and (3) they did not know, or have actual notice, that the tenant was illegally cultivating cannabis. This is where City’s cease-and-desist letters become useful in providing actual notice.\n\nCannabis Enforcement Costs Can Be Imposed as a Lien\n\nIn 2019, the Council passed an ordinance authorizing departments to recover costs for enforcement actions against unlicensed cannabis businesses. The legislative rationale and intent behind the ordinance was that enforcement costs are a drain on public resources that should be borne by the property owners renting to unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nFollowing the ordinance’s passage, the City Administrative Officer (CAO) requested the departments participating in unlicensed cannabis enforcement to compile and submit cost reports. Recoverable costs include direct and indirect costs for administrative and civil actions, while costs related to criminal enforcement are not allowed under State law. However, only LAPD and LADWP have, so far, regularly prepared reports on their recoverable enforcement costs to the CAO.\n\nEnforcement costs for administrative and civil actions can quickly add up. Based on available cost reports, the average cost for LADWP to disconnect utilities was about $640, but could vary widely depending on site-specific circumstances. LAPD’s recoverable enforcement costs in 2020 averaged over $4,400 per location. If reported, LADBS and LAFD’s code inspection costs can also be included. In addition, contract costs for padlocking a property are estimated to average $5,000 per site. The LAMC also allows the City to add a 40% administrative fee on top of enforcement costs proposed as a lien. But despite these potentially high costs, no departments have submitted their unlicensed cannabis enforcement costs to the City Council to be recorded as a lien.\n\nTo impose enforcement costs as a lien, participating enforcement departments should track costs on a location-specific basis. Cost reports prepared by LAPD and LADWP so far have combined all enforcement costs to report a per quarter or per year total. But since enforcement actions take place at hundreds of locations each year, it may be cost-prohibitive to track and impose liens on every location. The Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce should develop a policy to prioritize which locations should have a lien imposed.\n\nIn addition, the Taskforce should develop procedures to report costs as a proposed lien for the Council’s confirmation, following requirements laid out in the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) 7.35.3 or any other applicable law.\n\nReceiverships can be used to take control of properties housing unlicensed cannabis businesses\n\nAs a last resort, the City Attorney’s Office may consider incorporating receiverships as part of its litigation strategy to shut down unlicensed cannabis businesses. Receivers are court-appointed officers who carry out and enforce the court’s orders. If no other enforcement methods are likely to be effective, cities can petition the court to appoint a receiver that temporarily takes control of a property to abate a nuisance. We found several examples of other cities that successfully used receiverships to shut down unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nThe City of Riverside used receiverships extensively as part of its enforcement efforts. According to an Assistant City Attorney at the Riverside City Attorney’s Office, receiverships were a critical tool in its strategy to shut down over 30 illegal dispensaries between 2016 and 2018. While Riverside found early success in asking the court for an immediate order to appoint a receiver, the city had to change tactics in later years as the court became more willing to give property owners an opportunity to comply before moving to the drastic measure of taking over their property.\n\nTo address this issue, the Assistant City Attorney explained that Riverside was often able to get a temporary restraining order long before the civil case reached a judgment. Under the CA Drug Abatement Act, the State legislature declared that every building or place used to unlawfully sell, serve, store, keep, manufacture, or give away any controlled substance (including cannabis) is a nuisance that must be enjoined, abated, and prevented. If a prosecuting city attorney can demonstrate that a building is being used in this way, the court is required to allow a temporary restraining order or injunction to abate and prevent the continuance or recurrence of the nuisance.\n\nIn Riverside’s experience, illegal dispensaries typically continued operating in violation of the restraining order, resulting in the court’s appointment of a receiver to enforce the court’s order. The receiver would then be empowered to take full possession of the property and immediately remove the illegal cannabis business.\n\nJust the threat of losing their property could be enough to convince some property owners to stop leasing to unlicensed cannabis businesses. Should the City Attorney’s Office consider using receiverships in the future, then the City’s cease-and-desist letters should be modified to make it clear to property owners that their property could be the subject of a receivership takeover.\n\nSuccessfully using court-appointed receivers was a turning point for Riverside’s enforcement efforts against illegal cannabis businesses. According to Riverside’s Assistant City Attorney, holding the property owner responsible was critical for stopping new illegal marijuana storefronts from opening up. Several other local jurisdictions, including Santa Ana, Jurupa Valley, and others have used receivers to shut down illegal cannabis businesses.\n\nPer the CA Health and Safety Code, receiverships can also be appointed to take control of a substandard building that poses a danger to the health and safety of residents or the public. During inspections at unlicensed cannabis businesses, LADBS and LAFD often find significant building and fire code violations—including unapproved electrical work, unpermitted partition walls, and lack of exits—that meet the State’s definition for substandard buildings. Unlicensed cannabis businesses are also a nuisance under the City’s ordinance, another substandard building condition.\n\nAlthough typically used for residential properties, it is possible to use Health and Safety Code receiverships to take control of substandard commercial buildings as long as the City can make the case that a receiver is needed to remedy the situation. For example, Santa Ana’s City Council approved their City Attorney to use Health and Safety Code receiverships in at least four properties that housed six different illegal dispensaries. In its petition to appoint a receiver, Santa Ana described in detail the substandard conditions at the unlicensed cannabis business, as well as the extensive law enforcement and code enforcement efforts that have failed to bring it into compliance.\n\nIf appointed, Health and Safety receiverships offer several other advantages to address unlicensed cannabis businesses that refuse to shut down.\n\nGetting other parties involved – All persons with a recorded interest in the property, such as the mortgage-holding bank, must be notified that a petition for a receivership will be filed. These recorded interests could step in to require the property owner to stop the unlicensed cannabis activity.\nReceivership costs are the property owner’s responsibility – The receiver’s costs for managing and repairing the property are the property owner’s responsibility, and can be imposed by the court as a super priority lien above all other liens. The receiver can even enter into contracts, collect rents, and use the property as collateral to borrow and pay for repairs to correct violations on the property.\nCity enforcement costs may be recovered – If a substandard building is found to substantially endanger the health and safety of residents or the public, the court is required to order the property owner to pay for the City’s reasonable and actual costs, including for inspections, investigations, enforcement actions, attorney fees or costs, and all costs of prosecution.\n\nAlthough receiverships are a powerful remedy, obtaining them is not without challenges. The City Attorney’s Office notes that the courts are hesitant to implement receiverships, and that other cities that have used it to shut down illegal cannabis businesses do not have to contend with Los Angeles’ scale. While that may be true, receiverships may still be an effective, albeit drastic, remedy to shut down the most stubborn unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nWith some planning and coordination, the three enforcement tools described above are readily available for the City to use. However, they are by no means an exhaustive list of methods and tactics. To continue shutting down unlicensed cannabis businesses, the City should explore using any and all tools to hold property owners responsible for allowing unlawful activities to occur on their property.\n\nTo update its provisions to meet current needs and use the Administrative Citation Enforcement (ACE) Program against unlicensed cannabis businesses, the City Council should consider the following:\n\nInstruct LAPD and LADBS, with the assistance of the City Attorney’s Office and other relevant departments, to report back on how the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce could begin issuing administrative citations and fines to unlicensed cannabis businesses and property owners for the unpermitted improvements and unallowed uses they have caused or allowed. The report back should include:\nA decision on which department should issue administration citations for causing or allowing unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nThe process by which administration citations and fines would be issued as part of the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s progressive enforcement model.\nA determination if fines for unlicensed commercial cannabis activities can be quadrupled because cannabis-related activities are not a land use for which the City can issue a permit.\nAny necessary ordinance changes to facilitate the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s use of ACE citations and fines against unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nRequest the City Attorney’s Office for a report back evaluating the feasibility and implementation options for the following:\nAdopting any necessary changes requested by LAPD and LADBS to facilitate the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s use of ACE citations and fines against unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nAdding provisions to the ACE ordinance to target illegal cannabis cultivation, per Assembly Bill 2164 (2018), so that fines can be immediately imposed for violations that exist as a result of, or to facilitate, the illegal cultivation of cannabis.\nUpdating administrative fine amounts to track inflation.\nCreating collection procedures so that unpaid fines can be administratively imposed as a lien or special assessment.\n\nTo impose liens onto property owners for recoverable costs related to unlicensed cannabis enforcement:\n\nThe Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce, with the assistance of the City Administrative Officer, should develop protocols for selecting which properties will be subject to a proposed lien, and procedures for tracking, reporting, and confirming enforcement costs as a lien for allowing unlicensed cannabis businesses to operate.\n\nFinally, as a drastic remedy to shut down the most uncooperative unlicensed cannabis businesses:\n\nThe City Attorney’s Office should, as part of its civil litigation strategy, consider petitioning the court for a receivership to take control of unlicensed cannabis businesses and the property they occupy.\nREGULATORY MONITORING OF LICENSEES IS LACKING\n\nThe City enacted Measure M to license and regulate commercial cannabis activity and mitigate its potentially negative impacts, which include: (1) increases in use, particularly among youth; (2) quality-of-life issues for neighborhoods and communities near cannabis businesses; and (3) other unlawful activities such as drug trafficking or product diversion to or from the unlicensed market.\n\nWhile the 2021 LA County Public Health study found that unlicensed cannabis businesses were more likely to engage in concerning practices, the study also found that licensed dispensaries also had issues. For example, the public health researchers found that, among the 37 licensed dispensaries visited in late 2018 and early 2019, five offered free samples and two sold illegal high-potency cannabis products. Although licensed to operate as a legal cannabis business, a strong regulatory presence is still needed to mitigate the potential harm to consumers.\n\nTo create and maintain a well-regulated industry that protects Angelenos from the potential harms of cannabis-related activity, DCR must monitor and enforce licensee compliance with State and local laws.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF CANNABIS-RELATED COMPLAINTS HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED\n\nDCR receives complaints primarily through an online complaint portal on its website. From January 2018 through June 2022, DCR received over 7,300 cannabis-related complaints. Table 8 shows the workflow status, including 800 complaints that have been referred to LAPD for unlicensed cannabis enforcement, and 240 kept by DCR for further investigation because it relates to their licensees. Another 1,247 complaints have case notes or other activity indicating some level of review and action by DCR.\n\nHowever, more than 5,000 complaints remain unprocessed with no indication of their work status. We reviewed a limited number of unprocessed complaints and found that many could generally be categorized as follows:\n\npersonal cannabis use, which DCR does not regulate;\nalleged unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, which would be referred to LAPD;\nquality-of-life issues in connection with a licensed cannabis business, such as customer behavior in the public, which DCR believes is outside their regulatory purview; and\ncomplaints against licensed cannabis businesses that DCR should investigate.\n\nWhile we could not review and categorize all 5,000 unprocessed complaints, we found troubling allegations against licensed cannabis businesses, such as sales to minors and onsite cannabis consumption by employees—which are exactly the types of business behaviors and practices that DCR was established to regulate.\n\nWe identified one example which highlights the serious risks associated with a regulatory system that is unable to vet and investigate public health and safety concerns. DCR received a complaint about one licensed cannabis business that sold products that made consumers sick. A few months before it issued the business’ cannabis license, DCR received its first complaint about a customer that became violently ill after consuming a cannabis product that the business sold without a retail license. At the time of the complaint, the business in question was in the process of applying for its license to conduct cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution, all of which are non-retail activities that involve sales from one licensee to another licensee.\n\nSince then, DCR has received several more complaints about the business, though those complaints remain unprocessed. DCR referred the initial complaint to LAPD to investigate the allegation of unlicensed cannabis activity. But, per its 2018 cannabis enforcement guidelines, LAPD has deferred the complaint to DCR because the matter involves a business licensed by DCR. Though the complaints remain unsubstantiated, they raise enough concerns to warrant an investigation by DCR. During the course of our review, the business in question was still licensed for non-retail activities and continues to sell cannabis products to the public on its website.\n\nMany of the same types of troubling allegations can be found among complaints retained by DCR for further investigation and potential enforcement. Among the 240 complaints that DCR retained, 157 were still open or pending review as of June 2022. These 157 complaints also include allegations related to sales to minors, onsite consumption, and unlicensed activities by licensed businesses.\n\nDCR explained that it does not currently have the staff resources in place to investigate these complaints. In 2021, DCR submitted a request for positions that would focus on regulatory compliance, which was not acted on. Currently, DCR’s Licensing, Compliance, and Commission Support Unit is responsible for reviewing applications, as well as investigating complaints regarding commercial cannabis activity, and monitoring the compliance of licensed cannabis business. But given the public scrutiny DCR has faced, the Licensing, Compliance, and Commission Support Unit has mainly focused on application and license reviews. Investigations and compliance monitoring have suffered as a result.\n\nIn addition, DCR has not been able to hire and retain its special investigators. Through a work-sharing agreement with the Personnel Department, two special investigator positions are authorized and assigned to DCR to conduct complaint investigations. However, according to DCR, they have historically had problems hiring and retaining personnel for those positions and there is currently only one investigator.\n\nAs part of its State grant received in December 2021, DCR is now in the process of establishing a separate Compliance and Enforcement Division. According to the unit’s program manager, DCR is in the middle of the hiring process to bring on a total of two senior management analysts and two management analysts to supplement the special investigator that was recently hired. After these positions are filled, DCR plans to begin reviewing and investigating complaints.\n\nDCR HAS NOT CONDUCTED PERIODIC INSPECTIONS TO MONITOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\n\nIn addition to responding to complaints, creating a well-regulated business environment requires proactive measures like periodic compliance inspections. While DCR conducts site inspections as part of its licensing and renewal process, these inspections are scheduled in advance. This gives the business ample opportunity to prepare for and pass the inspection.\n\nHowever, conditions during a scheduled inspection may not represent actual business practices that could violate DCR’s rules and regulations. As with unprocessed complaints, DCR has not conducted periodic regulatory compliance inspections of its licensees because its personnel are primarily focused on application and license reviews.\n\nTo test compliance, we visited six cannabis retail stores licensed by DCR that historically had a high number of complaints or several concerning complaints. While onsite, we looked for compliance with a number of requirements that we believed should be plainly visible or apparent, covering violation types ranging from minor to major.\n\nAll six dispensaries followed certain basic requirements, such as conducting an identification check, having camera surveillance and security personnel onsite, and not providing free samples. However, we observed several regulatory violations at every dispensary we visited, including some categorized by DCR as moderate and major violations.\n\nWhile most violations we observed were minor, these requirements still serve to create a well-regulated business environment. For example, five of six dispensaries we visited did not display their neighborhood liaison’s contact information. Licensees are required to designate a neighborhood liaison that interacts with and takes complaints from the community. Many of the quality-of-life concerns that currently go to DCR should be addressed by the licensee and its neighborhood liaison instead.\n\nThe lack of proper exit packaging at some dispensaries was also problematic. The State requires exit packaging to be: (1) child-resistant to make it difficult for children under five years of age to open; and (2) tamper-evident to indicate to the customer if the package has been opened. Three of the six dispensaries sold cannabis products without proper exit packaging and used simple paper bags instead.\n\nTwo dispensaries also had cannabis products in containers that were easily accessible to customers without the assistance of the licensee’s personnel. For example, the containers shown in Figure 6 were openly displayed at the counter of a dispensary we visited, allowing any customer to walk up and inspect the quality of the cannabis. If the dispensary we visited was busier, it could have been difficult to prevent customers from taking the containers home without paying for the product.\n\nAnother dispensary we visited was in the process of upgrading its walk-up window. Sales through exterior openings, such as drive-throughs or walk-up windows, are strictly prohibited under DCR’s regulations. Major violations like this can be subject to administrative fines worth up to $42,026 (three times the current license fee).\n\nGiven how new cannabis’ legal status is under State law and the lack of inspections by DCR, violations are to be expected. DCR should make its regulatory presence known through frequent onsite visits and inspections to educate, train, and bring the industry into compliance.\n\nWe spoke with other jurisdictions that permit cannabis businesses and found that they conducted periodic inspections at every one of their licensees’ business premises. While the scale of licensed commercial cannabis activity in these jurisdictions are smaller by comparison, their regulatory experience offers lessons for the City. The frequency of inspections varied depending on the type of cannabis business, specific risk factors for each business type, the jurisdiction’s risk tolerance, and available staff resources. To standardize the inspection process, each of the local jurisdictions also developed policies and procedures, inspection checklists, and other tools to ensure consistency.\n\nA common theme among different local jurisdictions we spoke to was a concern about product diversion to or from the unlicensed market. For example, Yolo County permits commercial cannabis cultivation in unincorporated parts of the county, and inspects their cultivator’s operations monthly. According to Yolo County’s inspection program manager, cannabis can grow from seed to harvest in less than three months. In his view, it is necessary to inspect his cultivators at least once a month to track the inventory of cannabis plants at each stage of the growing cycle and mitigate the risk of product diversion.\n\nTo create a well-regulated business environment, DCR should develop a regulatory compliance plan that lays out how it will begin conducting periodic and proactive inspections and investigations. DCR should follow suit and also develop the necessary policies, procedures, and protocols so that it can consistently conduct inspections and investigations, and issue progressive discipline (such as warnings, notices of violations, fines, and license revocation) for the violations it finds.\n\nDCR NEEDS TO ADJUST REGULATORY LICENSE FEES\n\nDCR can set its own fees, subject to Council approval, to cover the cost of its regulatory regime. DCR’s license fees should include the cost of reviewing applications, issuing licenses, performing investigations and inspections, and activities required to regulate the cannabis industry. While DCR’s license and application fees do include the estimated costs of issuing an annual license, it does not include the cost of periodic compliance inspections throughout the year. If DCR had included the costs of inspections and investigations, it would have the revenue required to hire inspectors and investigators to respond to complaints and monitor regulatory compliance.\n\nA good practice for regulatory agencies is to include the full cost of compliance and monitoring into its fees. For example, the City’s tobacco retailer licensing program’s annual licensing fees include the cost of enforcement efforts like the decoy program to better ensure that retailers are not selling to minors. Other local jurisdictions we spoke to that permit commercial cannabis activities (including Sacramento, Yolo County, and Vista) fund their compliance efforts from the license fees they charge.\n\nAs part of its regulatory compliance plan, DCR should determine the frequency and estimated cost of regular inspections, investigations, and complaint responses. Given the number of complaints about sales to minors, DCR should also consider the need to develop a decoy program to test compliance with sales to minors. DCR should then factor these costs into its license fees as part of an updated fee study for the City Council’s approval.\n\nDCR MAY NEED TO REVISIT THE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS USED FOR ITS COMPLIANCE DIVISION\n\nDCR should continue with its hiring process to bring on new senior management analysts and management analysts so that it can begin responding to complaints and regularly inspecting licensed cannabis businesses as soon as possible. However, if DCR finds it challenging to hire suitable candidates or retain staff within its Compliance and Enforcement Division, it could be because management analyst job classifications are not the right fit for the job.\n\nStaff in DCR’s Compliance and Enforcement Division would essentially act as code enforcement officers, working in the public to enforce compliance with regulations that impact public health, public safety, and quality-of-life in the community. As code enforcement officers, DCR’s management analysts would likely spend most of their time out in the field to: (1) inspect and enforce compliance at over 700 licensed cannabis businesses; and (2) respond to complaints in a timely manner.\n\nInherent to any code enforcement officer’s job is the possibility of confrontation while interacting with members of the public that do not want to comply. In trying to gain compliance, conflicts may be inevitable and require DCR compliance staff to practice conflict management and resolution skills to de-escalate the situation. As part of their regular job, DCR’s Compliance and Enforcement staff would likely have to:\n\ngain access to and inspect or investigate a private cannabis business;\ninteract with business employees who may be adversarial; and\nissue progressive discipline that includes warnings, notices of violation, fines, and more.\n\nJob classifications in the City’s management analyst ladder are meant to handle a wide variety of administrative functions within the City, such as budgeting, program and grant administration, or human resources. It remains to be seen if management analysts can perform the duties of a code enforcement officer.\n\nIf DCR is unable to hire or retain sufficient staff in its Compliance and Enforcement Division, it should consider adapting an existing classification or creating a new inspector classification. Other cities use general code compliance officer job classifications to inspect licensed cannabis businesses. Unfortunately, the City does not have a general code inspector or compliance officers, and instead only has specialized classifications. If DCR cannot borrow an existing inspector classification, it should consider creating one for cannabis inspections.\n\nAs part of its regulatory compliance plan, DCR should also consider staff safety. Regardless of job title or classification, State law recognizes any government employee as a code enforcement officer if they have the authority to issue citations or file formal complaints to enforce any statute, rule, regulation, or standard to meet health, safety, and welfare requirements. California Senate Bill 296 (2021) requires all local jurisdictions that employ code enforcement officers to develop safety standards. To address safety concerns arising from the line of duty, DCR regulatory compliance plan should include safety standards and training for compliance staff.\n\nTo improve regulatory oversight of the licensed cannabis industry in Los Angeles, the Department of Cannabis regulation should:\n\nDevelop and implement a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan to monitor licensed cannabis businesses and enforce compliance. At minimum, the plan and its implementation should include:\nGoals and objectives for regulatory compliance, including how frequently DCR plans to inspect its licensees, how quickly it will respond to complaints, and how it will prevent sales to youth through programs like decoy operations.\nPolicies, procedures, and other documents to standardize, streamline, and provide guidance to staff on how the department will conduct periodic inspections and investigations of licensed cannabis businesses, respond to complaints, and issue progressive discipline.\nHow DCR will address unprocessed and pending complaints.\nSafety standards and training applicable to code enforcement officers inspecting or investigating licensed cannabis businesses.\nEstimated staffing and funding requirements to implement the plan.\nRevise its license and application fees to include the cost of carrying out its regulatory compliance plan.\nConsider adapting an existing or creating a new inspector or code enforcement job classification if it has difficulty hiring or retaining staff in its Compliance and Enforcement Division. Alternatively, DCR could enter into an agreement with another department to utilize inspector or code enforcement job classifications to conduct regulatory inspections of licensed cannabis businesses.\nFINANCE SHOULD REEVALUATE ITS CANNABIS AUDITS\n\nAs the industry continues to mature, cannabis has become a valuable source of General Fund revenue for the City. In FY2021, business taxes from the cannabis industry alone accounted for 20% of all business taxes collected by the City. To ensure that licensed cannabis businesses are current on their tax obligations, the City’s goal is to audit every business every two years. However, as DCR licensed more cannabis businesses, Finance has struggled to keep pace with this objective.\n\nIn addition, Finance could do more to address the risk of tax evasion that is associated with cash-heavy business operations like cannabis. For tax authorities like Finance, tax evasion through cash skimming, sales system manipulation, and other methods are a real threat to their mission of generating revenue to fund government services that serve all Angelenos.\n\nFINANCE IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP PACE WITH ITS TWO-YEAR CANNABIS AUDIT CYCLE\n\nTypically, cannabis businesses are due for their first tax audit one year after their initial registration with the department. Subsequent audits would be due two years after their last audit to maintain the two-year cycle. Beyond these timeframes, tax audits become overdue. From 2018 to September 2022, Finance completed 568 cannabis business tax audits and identified over $31.5 million in additional tax liabilities.\n\nHowever, many cannabis businesses are overdue for an audit. Finance must complete over 335 tax audits of cannabis businesses that are due or overdue in 2022 to keep up with its two-year audit cycle. This includes more than 224 tax audits that were due or overdue but not completed in 2021. As of October 2022, Finance had planned to complete 53 tax audits for the year, with the remaining due or overdue audits to be rolled over into the next year.\n\nTo try and keep up with the two-year audit cycle, Finance has increased the length of the tax period under review. In 2018 and 2019, Finance completed 277 tax audits, though most cannabis businesses did not have a lengthy business history to review. But beginning in 2020, a growing number of Finance’s audits have covered tax periods that are two or more years (see Table 11). For example, Finance completed 90 cannabis tax audits in 2021 that included tax periods covering two or more years.\n\nAs Finance’s audit backlog continues to grow, it faces an increased risk that it will not recover some taxes owed to the City. The LA Municipal Code generally limits Finance to filing an action to collect delinquent business taxes from the three most recent years, though the department is also allowed to make tax assessments going back as far as six years if there is a substantial understatement of 25% or more in taxes. As of December 2021, there were 19 cannabis businesses that registered with Finance in 2018 or 2019 and that have not been audited. If Finance were to audit these 19 businesses now, the general statute of limitations would prevent the department from filing a lawsuit to recover any taxes owed from cannabis sales before September 2019. Finance’s audit backlog will only worsen as the number of licensed cannabis businesses continues to increase.\n\nTo address this issue, Finance can either obtain more staff resources to accomplish its goal, or change its goal of auditing every cannabis business every two years. Finance completed 108 audits in 2020 and 113 audits in 2021, which the department believes is a reasonable workload that is on par with the pace of audits completed during the pandemic for other types of businesses. Finance also believes that achieving a two-year audit cycle helps to better ensure that the City will collect more taxes due from the newly legal cannabis industry; all tax periods within the three-year statute of limitations are audited for taxes due.\n\nBut unlike other commercial enterprises, the City has chosen to audit every cannabis business. Of the 499 tax audits completed through 2021, more than one-third (172) resulted in zero additional tax liability or a refund for the cannabis business. In addition, only 103 of the remaining 329 completed audits resulted in additional tax liabilities greater than $50,000. By choosing to audit every cannabis business, Finance is not effectively using its tax auditors to recover the most taxes due.\n\nFinance should reevaluate its goal to audit every cannabis business every two years, and consider a risk-based approach to select which businesses to audit. Finance could weigh business size, tax payment history, prior audit results, and other risk factors to select businesses to audit that are more likely to have large unpaid tax obligations. Otherwise, Finance should determine how many additional tax auditors it needs to meet the two-year audit cycle and present its request to policymakers for consideration.\n\nTAX AUDITS COULD DO MORE TO ADDRESS RISKS FOR TAX EVASION\n\nFrom the perspective of a taxing authority, businesses that tend to transact heavily in cash—including restaurants, laundromats, and retail cannabis—have a higher risk of tax evasion that should be addressed during audits. But despite having a specialized unit dedicated to auditing the industry, it is not clear what additional steps Finance is taking to mitigate the risk of tax evasion for cannabis sales.\n\nTax audits by Finance’s cannabis audit unit largely consist of desk procedures that do not go far enough to provide reasonable assurance that all gross receipts from all business activities are identified and taxed appropriately. Finance’s tax auditors typically establish gross receipts by reconciling total sales gleaned from accounting records, point-of-sale systems, tax returns, and other available documentation. A sample of transactions are also tested to ensure that the correct tax rate was applied, such as 10% for retail sales or 5% for verified medical sales.\n\nAlthough Finance stated that their tax auditors can and do take additional steps to verify cannabis business activities, such as onsite field visits, these steps are not documented or required. We did not find any additional procedures to address underreporting or other forms of tax evasion in Finance’s cannabis audit guide or in a sample of completed tax audits we reviewed.\n\nEven simple steps like checking the business’ website can be revealing and have implications for the tax audit. As discussed in an earlier section of this report, DCR issued a non-retail license to a cannabis business that was allegedly conducting unlicensed retail sales. Finance completed its tax audit of the same business several months later. During the course of the tax audit, the cannabis business admitted to conducting retail cannabis sales earlier that year, which should have been a red flag for Finance to take additional steps and ensure that all gross receipts were reported. One of those additional steps could have included reviewing the cannabis business’ application to Finance for a business tax registration certificate, which showed that it began operating in 2015, which suggests that it may have taxable gross receipts long before Measure M went into effect.\n\nWhile Finance could try to conduct tax audits more quickly to meet its two-year audit cycle, doing so could further compromise its ability to detect potential tax evasion. If Finance reevaluates its goal to audit every cannabis business every two years, the department should also rethink how it conducts cannabis tax audits to better assure that it can identify all taxes owed to the City.\n\nFinance should incorporate audit techniques used by other tax authorities when facing cash-heavy industries. For example, tax audit guides from the Internal Revenue Service and the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration emphasize the need to validate operations and review the business’ inventory, sales, and cash handling processes through field visits and interviews.\n\nInformation gained from these additional audit procedures help to assess the risk of underreporting and may identify areas that require further attention. If these tax evasion risks are identified, Finance’s tax auditors could use well-established audit techniques, like counting sales transactions to estimate revenue, reconciling inventory changes with sales, or inspecting the sales system to potentially identify unreported transactions. Although time-consuming to conduct, these additional audit steps could be worth the investment to identify potential tax liabilities from higher risk businesses.\n\nFINANCE’S PROTOCOL FOR ACCEPTING CASH PAYMENTS COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT\n\nTo accept cash payments from cannabis businesses for business taxes and DCR’s regulatory fees, Finance established a time-consuming cash-counting process to validate currency payments. For cash payments of $1,000 or more, cannabis businesses must make an appointment and present the payment in person. To ensure accuracy, two Finance staff conduct the cash count and verify the payment amount. In addition, because large, in-person cash payments present a security risk, two LAPD officers are onsite during these appointments to safeguard the process. According to Finance staff, a cash count appointment can range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes to conduct.\n\nIn FY 2022, Finance accepted over 1,500 cash payments over $1,000. These large cash payments represented 14% of transactions processed (10,638) for cannabis businesses and 21% ($26.3 million) of revenue received ($125.1 million). Meanwhile, the FY 2022 budget allocated for Finance’s cannabis cash collection operation and LAPD’s associated security services were almost $1 million. Although Finance states that it is legally required to accept cash payments, we found that there are more efficient ways to conduct this process.\n\nFor example, the City of Sacramento does not conduct its own cash count, instead relying on the cannabis business and the city’s banking partner to do it. Cannabis businesses in Sacramento are required to provide their cash payments in a bank deposit bag, which reduces their appointments down to five or ten minutes. By reducing the time required for each appointment, Sacramento staff believe that the security risk is also reduced to the point where they only need licensed security personnel onsite instead of police officers.\n\nSacramento then transfers the cash deposit bags to its bank to conduct a cash count to verify the amount. Because banks will always conduct a cash count, this saves Sacramento employees a step in their process. Sacramento will then debit or credit the cannabis business for any discrepancies between the taxpayer’s deposit and the bank’s cash count.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo more effectively audit and collect cannabis business taxes, Finance should:\n\nRe-evaluate its goal of auditing every business every two years and consider a risk-based approach to selecting which businesses to audit.\nReexamine their cannabis audit procedures and incorporate additional steps to mitigate the risk of underreporting and other forms of tax evasion.\nExplore other methods to accept cash payments from cannabis businesses more efficiently.\nSPENDING PRIORITIES FOR CANNABIS TAX REVENUE\n\nAs the State and the City changed their policy stance to support legalization, a focus of the Council’s policy discussion turned towards how commercial cannabis activity could be used to benefit disproportionately affected communities. For the City, this meant giving priority to cannabis license applicants that met one or more social equity criteria, such as having a prior cannabis arrest or conviction, residency status in an area disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs, or meeting the low-income threshold level. While DCR’s social equity licensing process is still ongoing, the City has many other options to consider to make an impact.\n\nIn 2018, City policymakers proposed the Cannabis Reinvestment Act. If enacted, the Cannabis Reinvestment Act would have created additional cannabis taxes beyond those imposed under Measure M and allocated the revenue for specific purposes, including youth development, social equity, and new services and projects for areas affected by newly licensed cannabis businesses. However, the Cannabis Reinvestment Act was never placed on the ballot for voters to consider.\n\nMore recently, a citizen-sponsored petition for a ballot measure known as the “Los Angeles Equity Fund: A Community Reinvestment Initiative” would have forced changes onto the current cannabis taxation regime. If passed, the initiative would reduce existing cannabis business taxes, and direct a significant portion of remaining tax revenues into a special fund for a variety of specified uses, including:\n\nsupport for social equity applicants;\nfunding for enforcement against unlicensed cannabis businesses;\njob and youth programs; and\na pilot slavery reparations program.\n\nThe petition has until March 2024 to gather enough signatures and file with the City for certification. If the citizen-sponsored petition makes it onto the next election cycle’s ballot, this would not be the first time the City would have to react to a ballot initiative that could take away its authority to set policy.\n\nMeasure M was quickly drafted in response to a competing initiative (Measure N) that would have restricted the City’s ability to create or amend regulations for commercial cannabis activities. More recently, an initiative placed on the March 2024 ballot would have allowed residents to file a lawsuit and force the City to implement Mobility Plan projects, garnering responses from the Council to find alternatives to carry out the Mobility Plan.\n\nThe fact that the petition for the LA Equity Fund initiative was approved for circulation demonstrates an ongoing debate on spending priorities the City should engage with. To inform the legislative discussion, the sections below describe how the City treats its cannabis business taxes, highlight several ways other jurisdictions have used their cannabis tax revenue, and provide several policy options for the City Council to consider.\n\nTHE CITY DOES NOT ALLOCATE CANNABIS BUSINESS TAXES FOR ANY SPECIAL PURPOSES\n\nLike property tax revenue, sales tax, and other business taxes, cannabis business taxes are deposited into the General Fund to fund general City services. As a valuable source of General Fund revenue, cannabis business taxes are not earmarked for any special purpose. However, the City can make General Fund appropriations to achieve specific policy goals tied to commercial cannabis activities. By contrast, DCR’s fees and other fund sources that make up the Cannabis Regulation Special Trust Fund can only be spent on activities related to DCR and its mission of regulating licensed cannabis businesses.\n\nSince the FY 2019 annual budget process, the City has budgeted some General Fund revenues for cannabis-related purposes, as shown in Table 12. While City policymakers have made changes to the annual budget throughout the fiscal year due to changing budget constraints and competing priorities, as a proportion of the cannabis business tax, the City has budgeted between 7% and 30% towards cannabis-related items.\n\nBecause it is just one of many General Fund revenue sources used to fund general City services, spending against the cannabis business tax cannot be tracked.\n\nSpending against budgeted cannabis business taxes could be tracked if City policymakers identified specific policy priorities, projects, or programs for the revenue source. For example, Long Beach’s annual budget tracks and summarizes how the city spends its cannabis business taxes. Although Long Beach’s cannabis business tax is a general tax, their city council prioritized spending of the tax towards cannabis regulation and enforcement, and public health and safety. Under Long Beach’s cannabis business tax, spending under public health and safety include the cost of:\n\ntwo Quality-of-Life police officers responsible for referring individuals to services and assisting in mental health evaluations;\na Clean Team to coordinate homeless cleanups in the City; and\nhealth Department programming to maintain support for homeless services\n\nThe following sections provide several more examples of other local jurisdictions allocating cannabis taxes toward specific uses and adjusting tax rates to support certain policy goals.\n\nCOUNCIL COULD STILL ALLOCATE A PORTION OF CANNABIS TAXES TOWARD SPECIFIC USES\n\nProp 64 has provisions to allocate a portion of cannabis taxes toward specific purposes. Likewise, the City could adopt an ordinance allocating a percentage of cannabis tax revenue or total dollar amount to achieve a specific policy or goal. Below are several examples of other cities that adopted policies, enacted ordinances, or proposed ballot measures to designate how their cannabis taxes can be used.\n\nVista – As part of its budget discussion, the Vista city council expressed an interest in capping the amount of cannabis tax revenue going toward the General Fund at $4 million, and using the excess revenue to fund special projects. For example, because FY 2021 cannabis tax revenues were estimated at $5.1 million, based on the City of Vista’s adopted policy, $1.1 million in excess revenues became available to be allocated for other projects. For the Vista’s operating budget for FY 2022 and FY 2023, the council used the excess funding to approve a variety of priorities, including youth scholarships, youth cannabis prevention and intervention, and other projects.\nSanta Cruz – In November 2017, the Santa Cruz city council adopted a policy to designate 12.5% of the city’s cannabis business tax revenue to create a dedicated Children’s Fund. The purpose of the Children’s Fund was to enhance and expand early childhood development and prevention programs, and vulnerable youth programs, without supplanting existing Santa Cruz services or investments. Taking it one step further, the Santa Cruz city council proposed a ballot measure in 2021 to amend its city charter and increase the cannabis business tax allocation to the Children’s Fund to 20%. The ballot measure was overwhelmingly approved by 83% of voters and enshrined the policy into Santa Cruz’s city charter.\nSanta Ana – Shortly after voters approved Measure Y in November 2018 to tax commercial cannabis businesses in Santa Ana, the city council passed an ordinance to create a cannabis public benefit fund. Two-thirds of all cannabis tax revenues are deposited into the fund, and currently at least half of the cannabis fund (one-third of cannabis tax revenue) must be allocated by the City Council to fund new, additional, or enhanced youth services. The remainder of the cannabis benefit fund (one-third of cannabis tax revenue) can be used to enforce cannabis regulations and other nuisance laws to improve the quality-of-life of residents. Since the cannabis fund’s creation, Santa Ana has spent its cannabis tax revenues to fund Library and Parks & Recreations programs for youth (including an anti-drug program), and enforcement and compliance efforts for both licensed and unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\nCity policymakers could do the same and adopt a policy, ordinance, or ballot measure to designate a portion of cannabis business taxes to fund the policy priorities that the Council expressed in its proposed Cannabis Reinvestment Act or any other new programs or projects.\n\nCANNABIS TAX RATES COULD BE REDUCED TO SUPPORT CERTAIN POLICY GOALS\n\nIn addition to spending cannabis business taxes, the City Council could also reduce the tax rate to support some policy goals. The current cannabis tax regime reflects the maximum tax rates allowed by Measure M. Relative to other jurisdictions, the City currently has one of the highest tax rates for adult-use retail sales.\n\nWhile any further increases would require voter approval, Measure M allows the City Council to lower tax rates by ordinance. Though this would result in lower revenue, lowering tax rates is one way to help the City incentivize or achieve certain policy goals. Below are several examples of other jurisdictions that reduced cannabis business taxes support policy goals.\n\nSupporting licensed cannabis businesses competing against unlicensed businesses – To enhance the competitiveness of its cannabis businesses, the Oakland City Council adopted an ordinance in 2019 to reduce its retail cannabis tax rate from 10% to a tiered-tax structure that caps out at 5%. In response to the cost of running a licensed cannabis business and to combat the illicit market, San Francisco has, for two years in a row, suspended its cannabis business tax in 2021 and 2022. Other cities like Long Beach and Costa Mesa have reduced their cannabis taxes for similar reasons. More recently, the State passed legislation to suspend its cannabis cultivation tax beginning in January 2023 to combat the illicit market and encourage consumers and businesses to enter into the legal, regulated cannabis market.\nAttracting certain types of licensed cannabis businesses – The City of San Diego reduced its tax rate for cannabis production facilities from 8% to 2% to attract more indoor cannabis farms and cannabis manufacturers to open their doors in the city. After finding that it had one of the highest cultivation taxes among peer local jurisdictions surveyed, the City of Desert Hot Springs also eliminated its $25.50 per square foot tax on cannabis cultivation on lots less than 3,000 square feet and set a flat tax rate of $10.20 per square foot.\nSupporting social equity or other policy goals – In addition to reduced tax rates, the Oakland city council adopted an ordinance in 2019 to create tax rebates that support social equity and other goals. Cannabis businesses in Oakland can qualify for a variety of tax rebates that can reduce their tax rate to as low as 2.5%. For example, cannabis businesses with a workforce that consists of 30% or more Equity Employees (that meet certain social equity criteria) can reduce their business tax rate by 0.50%.\n\nIf the City Council chooses to explore tax rate reductions to meet certain policy goals, it would have to balance those goals against other policy priorities, such as revenue generation and even public health. For example, some policy analysts argue that high cannabis taxes would decrease access among price-sensitive groups and incentivize the illicit market, while lowering cannabis tax rates could encourage use and increase the cost of marijuana use and abuse within the community.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nThe City should not wait to see if the citizen-sponsored petition becomes a ballot initiative and risk losing the ability to determine how much to tax cannabis businesses and how that revenue should be spent. Policymakers still have an opportunity to proactively decide how cannabis tax revenues should be spent to align with their priorities.\n\nTo maintain control and exercise their policymaking role, the City Council should:\n\nRevisit the goals and spending priorities expressed through its work on the proposed Cannabis Reinvestment Act, and consider developing and adopting a spending plan for cannabis business taxes.\nCONCLUSION\n\nMore than five years after legalization, the City’s oversight of commercial cannabis activity remains a work in progress. The continued presence of illicit cannabis businesses alongside unmonitored licensed businesses undercuts Measure M’s goal of providing safer and more accessible cannabis for Angelenos. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the City can create a more fair and well-regulated cannabis market, raise tax revenue, and achieve its desired policy outcomes connected to commercial cannabis activities.\n\nRECOMMENDATION TABLE\n\nNumber\n\n\t\n\nRecommendation\n\n\nResponsible Entity: City Council\n\n\n1\n\n\tInstruct LAPD and LADBS, with the assistance of the City Attorney’s Office and other relevant departments, to report back on how the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce could begin issuing administrative citations and fines to unlicensed cannabis businesses and property owners for the unpermitted improvements and unallowed uses they have caused or allowed. The report back should include:\nA decision on which department should issue administration citations for causing or allowing unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nThe process by which administration citations and fines would be issued as part of the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s progressive enforcement model.\nA determination if fines for unlicensed commercial cannabis activities can be quadrupled because cannabis-related activities are not a land use for which the City can issue a permit.\nAny necessary ordinance changes to facilitate the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s use of ACE citations and fines against unlicensed cannabis businesses.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\tRequest the City Attorney’s Office for a report back evaluating the feasibility and implementation options for the following:\nAdopting any necessary changes requested by LAPD and LADBS to facilitate the Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce’s use of ACE citations and fines against unlicensed cannabis businesses.\nAdding provisions to the ACE ordinance to target illegal cannabis cultivation, per Assembly Bill 2164 (2018), so that fines can be immediately imposed for violations that exist as a result of, or to facilitate, the illegal cultivation of cannabis.\nUpdating administrative fine amounts to track inflation.\nCreating collection procedures so that unpaid fines can be administratively imposed as a lien or special assessment.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\tRevisit the goals and spending priorities expressed through its work on the proposed Cannabis Reinvestment Act, and consider developing and adopting a spending plan for cannabis business taxes.\nResponsible Entity: City Attorney’s Office\n\n\n4\n\n\tAs part of its civil litigation strategy, consider petitioning the court for a receivership to take control of unlicensed cannabis business and the property they occupy.\nResponsible Entity: Multiple Departments\n\n\n3\n\n\tThe Cannabis Enforcement Taskforce, with the assistance of the City Administrative Officer, should develop protocols for selecting which properties will be subject to a proposed lien, and procedures for tracking, reporting, and confirming enforcement costs as a lien for allowing unlicensed cannabis businesses to operate.\nResponsible Entity: DCR\n\n\n5\n\n\tDevelop and implement a comprehensive regulatory compliance plan to monitor licensed cannabis businesses and enforce compliance.

Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\n\nNovember 10, 2022\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Michael Feuer, City Attorney\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Follow-Up Audit — Alert and Aware: Modernizations to improve NotifyLA, the City’s Emergency Mass Notification System\n\nIn August 2018, my office released the report, “Alert and Aware: Modernizations to Improve NotifyLA, the City’s Emergency Mass Notification System,” which examined the Emergency Management Department (EMD) and its use of NotifyLA, the City’s mass emergency alert system. The report identified several issues preventing the department from using the system as effectively as possible.\n\nSince then, EMD has taken important steps to improve its operation of NotifyLA by formalizing standard operating procedures and developing consistency in messaging and dissemination protocols. However, opportunities remain to improve the program with additional training courses, message templates and pre-scripted alert translations. \n\nGiven the increasing frequency and magnitude of emergencies affecting Angelenos, my office initiated this follow-up review to assess the EMD’s implementation of the initial report’s recommendations. The table below summarizes our evaluation of EMD’s ongoing efforts:\n\n2018 Recommendations \tStatus \tComments\nFormalize Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the activation of NotifyLA, and provide guidance and training to City departments on the importance of using NotifyLA and how they should request EMD to send notifications.\tImplemented\tLAFD, LAPD and EMD approved the Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy in 2021, which defines criteria and roles for the activation and use of public notification systems.\nRequire the dissemination of alerts via NotifyLA for any emergency that is communicated to the public by the City through other methods. \tImplemented\tThe Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy establishes NotifyLA as a primary contact method for all possible incidents requiring emergency notifications. \nExpand the use of generic pre- scripted alerts, which direct recipients to more detailed information on City websites and social media.\tImplemented\tEMD has developed pre-scripted messages for several scenarios and has templates for multiple message types for each scenario. \nDevelop protocols for the consistent dissemination of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) and submit them to the Emergency Operations Board for approval.\tImplemented\tThe Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy establishes protocols for the dissemination of WEAs depending on the severity and scale of a threat. \nRefine NotifyLA subscription campaign to demonstrate a clear value to potential subscribers.\tImplemented\tEMD actively encourages the public to subscribe to NotifyLA through Public Information Officers, City websites, social media, and informational postcards. \nEstablish protocols to require that all messages, including Wireless Emergency Alerts, be pre-scripted and translated from English to other commonly spoken languages.\tIn progress\tThe NotifyLA system has an automated Spanish translation feature for WEAs, and EMD has enough in-house Spanish speakers to translate all other pre-scripted alerts. However, no translations other than Spanish are possible for WEAs due to system limitations. \nDevelop a plan, including any needed funding, to facilitate translations of emergency alerts into the City’s commonly spoken languages.\tIn progress\tAll existing pre-scripted messages have been translated into Spanish. EMD is currently working with the Mayor’s Language Access Program to identify available funding for additional translations of non-WEA messages.\nWork with stakeholders to develop specifications for a new request for proposals and solicit competitive bids for the platform to support NotifyLA.\tIn progress\tEMD plans to develop a request for proposals for a citywide software purchasing contract in FY 2023-24. City departments, including the Harbor, that are leveraging EMD’s current contract, will be able to use the new contract.\nProvide subscribers with step-by-step instructions on how to filter messages for subscribers to define notifications that are relevant to them.\tNo longer applicable\tSince the previous report, EMD has transitioned from the Nixle platform to Everbridge which allows the department to access millions of phone numbers for emergency alerts in addition to opt-in subscribers. As a result, EMD is much less reliant on subscriber databases and the location information submitted by participants. \nWork with the Airport and Harbor departments to coordinate negotiations and contracting efforts, to provide the City with the best service agreement for the best price.\tWill not implement\tEMD will not fully implement this recommendation. LAWA’s current use of the Everbridge system is considerably different from EMD’s use of the platform. EMD is in the process of negotiating updated contract terms with the vendor, which will allow other departments interested in procuring services from the updated contract to piggyback off the new contract.\n\n\nWhile EMD has taken important steps to improve the delivery of emergency notifications as recommended in our 2018 report, there is still work ahead. Continued investment in our City’s emergency alert system is an investment in the safety and security of Los Angeles. I am encouraged by the findings of this follow-up report and I urge the City to continue seeking solutions that safeguard life and property no matter what challenges may lie ahead. \n\nSincerely,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nBACKGROUND\nAbout NotifyLA\n\nNotifyLA delivers alerts, warnings, and instructional messages to City residents and businesses during disasters or large-scale citywide events. The system also notifies recipients of necessary precautions, such as evacuations, curfews, or sheltering in place orders. Individuals are encouraged to subscribe to the service, which is free to the public, to remain informed during emergencies. Alerts can be communicated in several forms—recorded messages through landline phones, text messages through mobile phones, or mass emails—and may provide links to other sources with more specific and targeted information.\n\nNotifyLA runs on a platform from Everbridge, a software and public safety solutions provider. Everbridge maintains a database known as Resident Connection, which has more than 200 million landlines, VoIP (i.e., internet), and mobile phones in the United States that emergency managers can access to send out emergency alerts. Residents and business owners can also choose to opt-in to the NotifyLA system and add up to five addresses per account to ensure they receive alerts for those.  As of June 2022, there were approximately 1.7 million addresses covered by NotifyLA through Everbridge’s Resident Connection system, representing nearly three million separate phone lines. There are approximately 602,000 additional opt-in NotifyLA subscribers.\n\nWireless Emergency Alerts – In addition to sending notifications to opt-in subscribers, the City can send Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) when there is an imminent threat to safety or life. The City has an executed agreement with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), authorizing the use of NotifyLA to initiate WEAs through participating wireless carriers. Upon activating WEA, the City pushes alerts to mobile devices in affected areas via a federally-regulated communications network.\n\nAny individual with a WEA-enabled mobile device that is present in a designated geographic location during the notification will receive it, even if they are not a local resident, or an active NotifyLA subscriber. Similar to Amber Alerts, WEAs emit distinct ring tones and vibrations which can be particularly helpful for people with hearing or vision-related disabilities.\n\nAll City departments can request that EMD send a WEA, with LAFD and LAPD being the most common requestors. Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) has its own ability to send alerts independent of EMD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mayor’s Office requested WEAs to share public health information and available resources for people to keep themselves safe.\n\nSystem Platform – The City established its emergency mass notification system in 2009. LAPD, in partnership with LAFD, EMD, and the City’s Information Technology Agency (ITA), developed technical specifications for the system and selected web-based software platform Nixle to support NotifyLA. In 2015, Nixle was acquired by communications software company Everbridge. Since the previous review, EMD has fully transitioned NotifyLA to the Everbridge platform. EMD continues to pay for a Nixle subscription, which residents can use if they wish to receive alerts from neighboring jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies.\n\nKEY ISSUES FROM 2018 REVIEW\nInconsistent Dissemination of Alerts\n\nEMD lacked formal standard operating procedures for the activation and use of NotifyLA. In accordance with the City’s Emergency Public Information Annex, LAFD and LAPD are the incident commanders that determine the preferred method of sharing information during an emergency. If the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is not activated and staffed, depending on the nature of the emergency, either LAFD or LAPD acts as the lead department responsible for sending NotifyLA messages. Both departments may also choose to use other avenues of communication, including official press releases and public statements from City officials, social media, and websites. At the time of the previous review, this meant that LAFD and LAPD could choose to not use the NotifyLA system, even when advised to do so by EMD.\n\nInsufficient guidance on how and under what circumstances departments should request an alert to be sent also led to potentially critical information being inadvertently withheld from the public. During the 2017 La Tuna Fire, no alerts were delivered via NotifyLA despite the hundreds of notifications and statements disseminated by LAFD and elected officials. Just three months later, EMD elected to use NotifyLA to advise residents about initial evacuation orders in the Sylmar area for the Creek Fire, but did not use the system’s WEA functionality until they updated residents about evacuation orders later in the day.\n\nCustomizing NotifyLA to Meet Subscriber Needs\n\nNotifyLA alerts were limited to just two languages, English and Spanish—but the City infrequently sent alerts in Spanish. Census bureau data showed that in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, at least 185 languages were spoken at home and nearly half of households spoke English less than “very well.” Emergency notification systems used by the County of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) supported a minimum of five languages. New York City’s emergency notification system offered scripted alerts in thirteen languages.\n\nEMD staff at the time also expressed concerns about the efficiency of Nixle and the risk that subscribers would receive information that may not be useful. Nixle used a subscriber’s provided zip code to determine which notifications they received. Subscribers were not provided with instructions on how to limit messaging, so they may have been subject to messages not immediately relevant to them.\n\nCost Saving Opportunities\n\nAt the time of our previous review, EMD was paying approximately $235,000 annually for its Nixle subscription, a cost that represented 33% of the City’s Emergency Operations Fund annual budget. Both LAWA and the Harbor Department (Port) had comparatively lower costs for their service licensing agreements with Everbridge, paying a total of $97,000 and $23,000, respectively.\n\nCost differences may have been in part due to differences in procurement methods, as well differences in how the departments used the platform. Neither LAWA nor the Port used their platforms for public alerts, nor did they solicit public subscribers. Even so, the City may not have been receiving the best pricing and services from the system platforms that support NotifyLA. The system license was not purchased directly from the company and the City did not leverage other departments’ agreements with the same vendor.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FOLLOW-UP\n\nOverall, EMD has made significant progress in improving the NotifyLA program, but have yet to fully address the risks identified in our previous review:\n\nfive recommendations were implemented;\nthree recommendations are in progress (the department continues to work toward full implementation);\none recommendation will not be implemented (the department has determined implementation is unnecessary); and\none recommendation is no longer applicable.\n\nWhile EMD has formalized emergency notification procedures, it must continue to train City departments on policies and procedures regularly so that departments are fully prepared to use NotifyLA as a public safety tool. The department has developed generic, pre-scripted alerts to make the notification distribution process more efficient. However, EMD has been unable to develop a comprehensive translation program for emergency notifications, despite a significant portion of the Angelenos speaking languages other than English.\n\nIn June 2021, LAFD, LAPD, and EMD approved the Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy, which defines criteria and roles for the activation and use of public notification systems. The policy includes procedures for determining the notification types and distribution methods, depending on the severity and scale of a threat.\n\nEMD provides additional guidance and templates in their NotifyLA Message Sending Guide, and hosts training for all City agencies that can request notifications (LAFD, LAPD, LAWA and the Harbor Department). Departments authorized to send notifications (EMD, LAFD, and LAPD) are also responsible for tracking internal training for their own departmental operating procedures. EMD is also planning to provide training to the Office of the Mayor.\n\nThe Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy establishes NotifyLA as a primary contact method for all possible incidents requiring emergency notifications. In all instances, information will be shared via texts, emails, the NotifyLA app, and social media; phone calls are optional depending on the time of day and the urgency of the situation.\n\nThe Emergency Operations Board (EOB), composed of the Police Chief, the Fire Chief, and the heads of 15 City departments and offices, has reviewed the Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy. While the policy was not approved by the full EOB, the policy was signed by the Police Chief and the Fire Chief (who serve as Chair and Vice-Chair) respectively, and EMD’s General Manager.\n\nSince the previous review, EMD has developed pre-scripted messages for the following scenarios: wildfire, debris flow, hazardous material release, active shooter, “avoid the area”, curfew, and general evacuation. Each scenario has templates for multiple message types, including English and Spanish WEAs, text messages, phone messages, and emails. EMD is in the process of developing templates for additional disaster scenarios.\n\nThe Emergency Public Information and Warning Policy establishes protocols for the dissemination of WEAs depending on the severity and scale of a threat. Whether notifications are sent to targeted areas or citywide, WEAs are only initiated when the public needs to take actions to preserve life and safety.\n\nThe NotifyLA system has an automated Spanish translation feature for WEAs, and EMD has enough in-house Spanish speakers to translate all other pre-scripted alerts.  However, no translations other than Spanish are possible for WEAs due to system limitations. The department will need additional funding for other language translations.\n\nAll existing pre-scripted messages have been translated into Spanish. EMD is currently working with the Mayor’s Language Access Program to identify available funding for additional translations of non-WEA messages. EMD anticipates it will be able to develop additional translations by the end of 2024, though specific implementation date targets are dependent on funding availability.\n\nEMD actively encourages the public to subscribe to NotifyLA through Public Information Officers, City websites, social media, and informational postcards. The department’s website now specifies the types of alerts subscribers will potentially receive through NotifyLA and Nixle, and includes links to sign in to both platforms so users can manage their settings. EMD also advertises NotifyLA through their public program campaigns, including extreme heat programs that offer information about local cooling centers.\n\nIn the future, the department plans to use grant funding to further develop public awareness campaigns. EMD’s subscription to Everbridge Resident Connection, which allows the department to access millions of phone numbers for emergency alerts in addition to opt-in subscribers, means NotifyLA’s success is less reliant on public outreach and subscription campaigns.\n\nSince the previous review, EMD has transitioned from the Nixle platform to Everbridge. EMD’s subscription to Everbridge Resident Connection allows the department to access millions of phone numbers for emergency alerts in addition to opt-in subscribers. As a result, EMD is much less reliant on subscriber databases and the location information submitted by participants.  Individuals still have the option to subscribe to Nixle and set location and message delivery settings if they wish to receive updates from other government agencies.\n\nEMD will not fully implement this recommendation.  LAWA’s current use of the Everbridge system is considerably different from EMD’s use of the platform. LAWA uses a visual control center for operational coordination, and EMD pays for a mass notification program for public emergency alerting. EMD is in the process of negotiating updated contract terms with the existing vendor. City departments interested in procuring services from the updated contract will be able to piggyback off the new contract through individual agreements with the service provider.\n\nEMD plans to develop a request for proposals for a citywide software purchasing contract in FY2023-24. Other City departments, including the Port and departments that are leveraging EMD’s current contract, will be able to use the new contract.  EMD is working with the City Attorney’s Office and other departments to coordinate the procurement process."

Continued development of the DSW program is necessary to mitigate the impact of the next crisis event. I urge the City to continue seeking lasting solutions to address the gaps in its emergency response efforts. \n\nSincerely,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe City’s Disaster Service Worker Program\n\nPursuant to California State law, Mayor Villaraigosa issued Executive Directive 16 (ED 16) in 2011 to declare all non-sworn City employees as DSWs that will serve in times of need. All civilian City employees sign an Affirmation of Loyalty during the hiring process, and documentation is filed with the City’s Personnel Department (Personnel) and the employee’s own department. Every registered employee—regardless of classification—is required to complete DSW training, including periodic refresher training.\n\nScope of Disaster Service Duties – Employees acting as DSWs may be reassigned to perform a variety of critical support roles outside the scope of their normal job duties and schedules, but they are never expected to perform any duty or function beyond their ability or skill set. Prior to deployments, DSWs are provided with training and protective equipment (if necessary) to allow them to complete their assigned duties safely. General DSW duties include, but are not limited to:\n\nclerical support;\nanswering phone lines;\ndelivering supplies;\npreparing and serving food; and\nmanaging volunteers.\n\nDSWs may also be assigned or choose to volunteer for more specific disaster response duties such as working in City emergency operations centers or a Red Cross shelter.\n\nDSW Deployment Process – Upon official proclamation of a local emergency, the Mayor can activate the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC), where the Emergency Management Department (EMD) coordinates emergency response activities between key City departments, regional organizations, and outside agencies. Field responders request resources and assistance from DSWs through the EOC, and the EOC’s Personnel Unit first fulfills requests with EOC representatives and people formally trained and registered to engage in disaster service. If additional staff resources are necessary, the EOC can advise the Mayor to activate the DSW program to fill operational needs.\n\nUpon the Mayor’s official activation of the DSW program, the EOC’s Logistics and Personnel section representatives are tasked with compiling a list of mission needs or tasks to determine the type and number of DSWs required, necessary skills, and reporting locations. The EOC then submits the request to the Personnel Department, which contacts Department Personnel Officers (DPOs) of individual City departments. DPOs, who manage personnel functions in their respective departments, identify appropriate and available employees and assign DSWs until all requested positions have been filled.\n\nCOVID-19 Activation\n\nIn March 2020, the City activated the DSW program for the first time as part of its COVID-19 pandemic response. Almost every City department deployed DSWs to help with urgent missions, including contact tracing, sheltering unhoused residents, and assisting the Los Angeles Unified School District’s relief efforts. Nearly 5,000 City employees served in various emergency missions across the City, covering approximately 50,000 different shifts, operating 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. The DSW program remains activated and continues to support the City’s COVID-19 response missions.\n\nHowever, the DSW deployment process proved to be difficult for the Personnel Department due to its own staffing constraints, the sheer volume of DSWs needed, refusals by employees to carry out DSW duties due to health concerns, and the amount of coordination required to ensure City employees assigned as DSWs remained safe amidst the pandemic. Before a DSW deployment could proceed, Personnel representatives and requesting departments planned everything from meal accommodations to personal protective equipment and safety measures.\n\nIn June 2020, Mayor Garcetti issued Executive Directive 26 (ED 26) to clarify how the DSW program would be administered throughout the duration of the emergency. The directive included the following instructions:\n\na task force led by the Office of the Mayor, in consultation with Personnel and comprised of EMD and other department representatives, is tasked with administering DSW program operations;\nPersonnel shall work with EMD to ensure disaster training is approved, documented and supervised, and commensurate with DSW duties; and\nall department heads must identify a minimum of 10% of their respective workforces in Continuity of Operations Plans (COOPs) for a DSW bench list that can be made available immediately.\n\nIt is important to note that while the Personnel coordinates and tracks deployments for the DSW program citywide, some departments may deploy DSWs independently of the program to support their own departmental missions. For example, the Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) acts as the lead department for mass care during an emergency. As a result, RAP has deployed their own DSWs to help operate interim housing at Project Roomkey sites. Personnel will not reassign an employee as a DSW from departments that have already dedicated staff to support the continuity of critical functions.\n\nThe City’s first-ever real world DSW activation and the challenges it has encountered administering the program highlight not only the program weaknesses we found during our previous review, but the need for clear policies, prepared employees, and processes that allow for the smooth, rapid deployment of DSWs.\n\nKEY ISSUES FROM 2019 REVIEW\nInsufficient Deployment Policies and Procedures \n\nThe EOC’s Personnel representatives are responsible for working with City departments to identify staff to deploy to the location of an emergency event, but the City had no true database of complete and current employee contact information to efficiently facilitate the assignment and deployment of DSWs. Individual City departments were expected to collect and maintain contact information for their employees. Since some City employees cannot be diverted from essential or critical department functions, departments must identify which employees are available for temporary reassignment.\n\nIn a Controller survey of ten departments, the methods for reaching out to employees for DSW deployment varied. Some departments planned to extract contact information from the City’s payroll system, or collect information directly from employees and transfer data into a departmental database or spreadsheet. Other departments assumed they would be able to rely on supervisors to have contact information for their staff.\n\nWithout access to current and complete employee information, the City lacked a method to prioritize specific departments, employees, or skillsets for DSW assignment. In a 2015 training exercise that simulated a DSW activation, the Personnel Department did not have a plan for identifying and prioritizing departments or employees and resorted to selecting departments in alphabetical order. In a real-world activation, this presents logistics challenges and can impact the timeliness of necessary deployments.\n\nLack of Employee Awareness\n\nED 16 requires all employees registered as DSWs to complete DSW training, including periodic refresher training, to enhance skills necessary for engaging in designated DSW activities. At the time of the previous review, EMD had developed one mandatory online training course that all new employees were required to complete within 30 days of hire. The training informed employees of their obligation to comply with the DSW program and administered an oath of loyalty.\n\nA supplemental training course, intended to be viewed prior to DSW assignment, was also made available. However, the City had not established regular refresher training for employees to revisit DSW program requirements, and not all employees were aware of potential duties they might be asked to perform as DSWs. Additionally, there were no protocols that clearly defined when and how compliance with mandatory training should be enforced, or the range of potential disciplinary actions that should take place if employees fail to comply with DSW obligations.\n\nTo assist DPOs, EMD and Personnel developed a “DSW Toolkit,” with instructions, checklists, and forms to be used during a DSW activation. The toolkit provides examples of various jobs that a DSW may perform, but it was only shared with DPOs, and all ten departments surveyed by the Controller’s Office appeared to be unaware of it.\n\nDSW Deployments Were Not Regularly Practiced During Exercises\n\nEach year, the EOC conducts a large-scale functional exercise, often in conjunction with other agencies, that simulates various emergency scenarios so the City can identify opportunities to improve its response to catastrophic events. Regularly testing the DSW program helps to reinforce field responders’ awareness of DSWs as a resource option, and allows them to familiarize themselves with the request and deployment process.\n\nSince the inception of the DSW program, the City only held one drill that simulated the deployment of DSWs and tested the program’s capabilities. That drill took place during the EOC’s 2015 Functional Exercise. EMD’s after-action report for the exercise indicated that Personnel reached out to participating DPOs to identify potential DSWs, but representatives did not actually contact any employees in their respective departments. In addition, the exercise failed to properly gauge employee response, establish methods of prioritization, and fully identify potential issues.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FOLLOW-UP\n\nThe City made progress in improving the DSW program, but has yet to fully address the risks identified in our previous review:\n\ntwo recommendations have been implemented;\ntwo recommendations have been partially implemented (the department has partially implemented the recommendation, but will not take further action); and\nthree recommendations are in progress (the department continues to work toward full implementation).\n\nEMD and Personnel still lack employee information and pre-planned deployment methodologies for DSW activations. To ensure the City is able to reach employees during DSW activations and efficiently deploy staffing resources, EMD and Personnel must develop Citywide methods or standards for individual departments to collect and maintain sufficient employee contact information. Furthermore, there are generally no consequences for not participating in mandatory training or complying with DSW assignments, which increases the likelihood of employees either failing to report for their mandatory service to the public, or being unprepared when they report for service.\n\nContact Information – ED26 required all City departments to identify a minimum of 10% of their respective workforces for a DSW bench list that can be made available immediately. The Personnel Department manages the Citywide bench list, but does not have a process to regularly update it. For future DSW activations, Personnel would need to contact DPOs to gather updated contact information. According to the Personnel Department, it is exploring the feasibility of allowing employees to self-certify some DSW information within Workday, the City’s new human capital system. However, DPOs will always play a central role in gathering and confirming contact information.\n\nSkillsets – When the DSW program was first activated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Personnel distributed a one-time citywide survey to collect skillset information from employees and established a current skills list. Specialized skills might include fluency in other languages, vehicle licenses, certifications, or the ability to use or supply specific equipment. Personnel plans to issue annual reminders for employees to update their information and can re-issue the survey in preparation for an activation. The department reports that it is working with ITA to assess the feasibility of incorporating a skillset self-certification process into Workday.\n\nAs required by ED 26, City departments have identified 10% of their respective workforces for a DSW bench list that can be made available immediately to support the City’s COVID-19 response. Personnel currently uses this list, which includes basic information about employee classifications, as its primary method of prioritization. However, this one time-survey does not fully satisfy the intent of the recommendation since the list is only effective throughout the duration of the City’s pandemic response.\n\nAccording to EMD and Personnel, determinations as to which skillsets or City classifications are best suited for an emergency mission are made at the time of the activation and based on the emergency need. The departments also determined that unless special skills are required for the assignments, all City employees should be able to perform DSW duties with just-in-time training, even if duties are outside their usual job classification roles.\n\nDSW training courses are currently available on Cornerstone, the City’s online training platform. All employees are required to complete an initial Mandatory Loyalty Oath Training course during employee onboarding which provides an overview of the DSW program. Personnel plans to reassign this course annually within Cornerstone and establish due dates.\n\nEMD and Personnel have also developed four new DSW refresher training course videos since the issuance of ED 26. These videos include:\n\nPart 1: Activation and Deactivation;\nPart 2: Employee and Family Preparedness;\nPart 3: Possible Locations and Roles; and\nPart 4: Resilience and Psychological First Aid.\n\nThe courses are available to all City employees but are not yet required. EMD and Personnel plan to require the training within Cornerstone beginning in November 2022.\n\nCornerstone is equipped with a reporting feature to track training completion. Personnel and DPOs can generate reports to monitor training progress. To help enforce compliance, Personnel plans to establish annual due dates for refresher training, which would be prompted by notifications sent through Cornerstone. Personnel plans to monitor training compliance on a quarterly basis beginning in January 2023.\n\nPersonnel has created a training video for DPOs entitled, “DSW Personnel Directors” that provides information about the role DPOs play in DSW deployment. Personnel will assign this training video to DPOs annually as a refresher. Personnel has also updated the DSW Toolkit resource for DPOs. The toolkit is available on Personnel’s intranet site. The department plans to update the toolkit on an ongoing basis moving forward.\n\nCity job bulletins currently state that City employees are required to serve as DSWs. While Personnel is limited in the amount of additional details they can include on job bulletins, DPOs and managers communicate are expected to convey additional DSW information to employees when they accept an offer of employment. Employees are also required to sign a DSW acknowledgement form.\n\nEMD is in the process of developing an official memorandum describing DSW requirements and policies. According to Personnel, an employee that fails to fulfill a DSW assignment may be subject to disciplinary action based on the City’s existing personnel policies for insubordination.\n\nAccording to EMD’s Training and Exercises Division, EMD now tests the DSW program as part of their annual EOC activation exercise. EMD reports that the exercise tests numerous scenarios to prepare the Personnel Department Operations Center and the EOC’s Personnel Unit Leader. EMD should continue to test DSW deployments on a regular basis to verify departments’ employee mobilization and deployment capabilities."

Ready for Emergencies \n\nWhen disaster strikes, residents and businesses rely on their local government to serve as the first line of defense against catastrophic damage to life and livelihood. In recent decades, the City has faced numerous unexpected crises—from the devastating ‘94 Northridge earthquake to the recent COVID-19 pandemic—that have necessitated immediate, wide-ranging emergency response operations. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Los Angeles is located in the most at-risk region for disasters in the United States. As the impacts of climate change become more pronounced and new threats such as cybersecurity attacks emerge, it is clear that a robust emergency preparedness program is required. \n\nWhile several entities play an important role in responding to disasters, the Emergency Management Department (EMD) is the primary department responsible for coordinating the City of Los Angeles’ emergency planning and response. Its programs are the subject of my latest report. \n\nEMD is tasked with a range of duties to ensure that L.A. is prepared for potential catastrophe. Although EMD has developed a comprehensive set of emergency plans, the department has fallen well short of effectively addressing ongoing and emerging risks. The toll of COVID-19 strained EMD resources and staffing, causing several existing preparedness programs to lag behind, likely impacting the City’s readiness for future emergencies. New strategies are needed to close planning gaps and ensure that all City departments have the essential resources to mitigate economic impact and preserve life and property in the event of an emergency. \n\nFalling behind \n\nEMD maintains a citywide Emergency Operations Plan, as well as 40 supplemental plans that are specific to various hazards and operations functions. However, some of the most pressing concerns facing the City remain unaddressed. There are currently no dedicated plans covering cyberattacks, climate change, drought or high-rise building fires. In addition, EMD has been unable to provide departments with technical reviews of their “Department Emergency Plans” and “Continuity of Operations Plans.” While departments are submitting these plans yearly, the quality varies significantly and assistance from EMD has been unavailable for departments who need it. \n\nDuring an emergency, departments coordinate with EMD’s Emergency Operations Center to obtain resources and supplies, but neither EMD nor the General Services Department perform regular supply or equipment needs assessments to ensure departments have the resources they need to respond effectively to a major disaster. The isolated approach to assessing emergency supply inventories limits planning and increases the risk that the City will have to rely on rapid procurement or assistance from outside agencies in the event of a large-scale emergency. \n\nBetter strategy needed\n\nWithout a strategy to improve the City’s plans and protocols that mitigate the impact of disasters, the safety and security of Angelenos will remain at risk. My report recommends the following actions to more effectively prepare for unexpected events:\n\nDevelop new plans to prepare the City for cyberattacks, climate change, drought, high-rise building fires and other high-risk incidents.\nEstablish a new agreement with L.A.

Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nWhen a disaster occurs, communities and businesses rely on their local government to act swiftly to preserve life and property and lessen the disaster’s impact to the greatest extent possible. Disaster response is particularly important for the City of Los Angeles (City). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rated Los Angeles County as the most at-risk region in the United States for disasters, based on an analysis of natural hazard threats and community risk factors.\n\nSafely navigating a city through an emergency requires careful planning, a robust training program, and constant analysis of risk factors and corresponding mitigation efforts. The Emergency Management Department (EMD) is the lead department for citywide emergency planning and response coordination. The department has a broad range of responsibilities, including development of citywide plans, administering training, managing the City’s emergency public communications systems, and maintaining the readiness of the City’s disaster response operations hub (known as the Emergency Operations Center or EOC).\n\nThis report examines the City’s emergency preparedness program and its readiness for future emergencies. EMD’s COVID-19 response workload and staffing shortages have expectedly strained the department’s emergency preparedness programs in recent years. As the public health emergency subsides, it is critical that the City take proactive steps to confront existing and emerging risks.\n\nWhat We Found\n\nEMD has developed emergency response plans for natural and manmade hazards, as well as functional plans covering logistics, business, and continuity of operations. This includes the citywide Emergency Operations Plan, and 40 supplemental support annexes and appendices detailing specific plans and protocols. But many of the department’s preparedness programs have fallen behind, likely impacting the City’s readiness for future emergencies.\n\nAlthough EMD has planned extensively for multiple disaster scenarios, planning gaps exist for several urgent, emerging risks facing the City. EMD does not have plans covering cyberattacks or special event incidents. The department also lacks dedicated plans for climate change, drought, and high-rise building fires, but other existing emergency plans at least partially address the risks associated with those three hazards.\nEMD has been largely unable to provide technical assistance to departments when they develop their annual Department Emergency Plans and Continuity of Operations Plans. Department Emergency Plans describe a department’s disaster response operations and protocols, while Continuity of Operations Plans describe protocols for ensuring the continuity of department services and systems. Smaller departments and departments without emergency management expertise tend to require more assistance.\nEMD has very little information about the credentials, skills, and qualifications of employees designated by departments to staff EOC roles. Without additional information and planning, EMD lacks full assurance that EOC responders can effectively fulfill their emergency management duties.\nEMD has cut back on both training and exercises since the start of the pandemic, limiting its ability to prepare employees and departments for disasters in a hands-on setting. The department is currently in the process of overhauling its training and exercise program to focus more on specific high-risk hazards.\nEMD has not been tracking the implementation of program improvement recommendations that are developed based on lessons learned from real-world EOC activations and exercises. Even when the department was monitoring recommendations, implementation proved difficult. From 2013 through 2019, EMD tracked 359 recommendations, of which only about half were implemented.\nNeither EMD nor the City’s logistics and procurement department, the General Services Department (GSD), perform a regular supply or equipment needs assessment to ensure the City has the resources it needs to respond to catastrophic incidents, such as a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack.\nWhat We Recommend\n\nThe City must take proactive steps to consider the range of disasters and operational risks it is facing, and implement new plans, protocols, and capabilities that allow all departments to quickly and effectively serve Angelenos during an emergency. Specifically, EMD and its partners should take the following steps.\n\nDevelop new plans or update existing plans to prepare the City for new and emerging risks, including cyberattacks, special event incidents, climate change, drought, high-rise building fires, and any other high-risk incident or function not yet fully addressed by existing plans.\nDevelop a roster of designated, qualified responders likely to fulfill EOC duties during an activation. Roster information could include credential status, position classification, relevant skills, and relevant training.\nExpand hazard-specific training opportunities and exercise events for City employees.\nEstablish a formal policy addressing the development of after-action reports, and the implementation and monitoring of program improvement recommendations.\nConduct a disaster response asset gap analysis to identify resource needs for major, non-seasonal hazards likely to impact the region.\nDetermine whether any new mutual aid agreements are needed to ensure the City can secure support from outside agencies when its own resources are insufficient for a disaster response operation.\nDevelop a new agreement with the County of Los Angeles establishing coordination roles, mutual aid protocols, and a joint City and County emergency management organization to support interagency coordination, planning, and process improvement on an ongoing basis.\nDevelop an engagement plan targeting industries and businesses with critical community resilience roles, and establish partnership strategies addressing the private sector’s role in supporting the disaster response and recovery efforts.\n\nProtecting Los Angeles residents and businesses during an emergency is one of the City’s most important responsibilities. By implementing the solutions proposed in this report, the City can accelerate its emergency preparedness efforts and improve its readiness for future emergencies.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDisaster planning, response, and recovery are among the most important responsibilities of government. The Los Angeles region is particularly vulnerable to disaster threats. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Risk Assessment, which analyzes natural hazard threats and community risk factors, rated Los Angeles County as the most at-risk region in the United States with a risk index score of 100—the national average was 11.\n\nSeveral historical natural and manmade disasters highlight the need for the City of Los Angeles (City) to remain vigilant and prepared.\n\nThe 1963 Baldwin Hills Reservoir Failure was a catastrophic structural failure caused by previously undetected erosion beneath the dam. Rushing water carrying pieces of concrete and other debris damaged nearby neighborhoods. The event resulted in the deaths of five people.\nThe Civil Unrest of 1992, which began following the acquittal of four police officers that were filmed using excessive force against Rodney King, lasted for four days. The events resulted in an estimated 60 deaths, and more than 1,000 buildings were destroyed by fires.\nThe 1994 Northridge Earthquake caused serious damage in Los Angeles and in surrounding areas. The magnitude 6.7 earthquake damaged homes and businesses, caused freeways to collapse, and caused power system failures throughout the region. The earthquake caused 57 fatalities.\n\nAn effective emergency response framework is needed to protect the safety of Angelenos during a natural disaster or other sudden emergency. Beyond public safety, it is essential that the City take steps to prevent property damage and minimize economic impact to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThe purpose of this review is to evaluate the City’s emergency preparedness program and identify additional steps the City should take to ensure it has the plans, staffing, and resources in place to protect Angelenos during a disaster. The efficiency and effectiveness of the City’s emergency operations center was not a primary focus of this review.\n\nWhile we considered issues related to the City’s COVID-19 pandemic response, it was also not the focus of this review. The City retained an outside consulting firm to complete a formal review of the City’s COVID-19 response. The consultant completed a report in June 2022. Their findings and recommendations were developed independently of this review.\n\nEmergency Management Roles and Responsibilities\n\nThere are several entities that play an important role in the City’s emergency planning and response efforts, but the Emergency Management Department (EMD) is the City’s lead department for emergency planning and coordination. EMD does not act as a first responder, but instead facilitates interdepartmental coordination and communication across all City departments during an emergency. Specific responsibilities of EMD include, but are not limited to:\n\ndeveloping and updating citywide risk assessments and emergency preparedness plans;\ndeveloping and administering disaster preparedness training and exercises;\nmanaging outreach and training for members of the public and business communities;\nmanaging the City’s emergency alert system and its use of federal alert systems;\ncoordinating with other City departments and the City’s personnel managers to support administration of the Disaster Service Worker Program, which temporarily redeploys City workers away from their normal duties to assist with emergency response operations; and\nliaising with federal, state, and local partners to support intergovernmental planning and response activities.\n\nEMD is also responsible for maintaining the operational readiness of the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which can be activated at any time by the Mayor, Council President, or designated department heads. The EOC is the City’s central hub for emergency operations, communications, and response, and is equipped to facilitate the City’s response to a wide variety of hazards and incidents, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, and terrorism.\n\nThe EOC was designed and organized for compliance with federal and state incident management standards. The EOC has the capacity for approximately 200 people, but the number of people staffing the center varies based on activation and incident type.\n\nEmergency Operations Organization and Emergency Operations Board\n\nIt is important to note that EMD is not solely responsible for the City’s emergency planning and response activities. During both emergency and non-emergency periods, representatives from all departments convene to form a centralized decision making and coordination agency known as the Emergency Operations Organization (EOO). The EOO, which was created by City ordinance, provides for a formal chain of command and information sharing structure to promote efficiency across departments. The organization coordinates its activities through the EOC during an emergency.\n\nThe governance body responsible for overseeing the EOO’s planning, response, and recovery functions and enforcing emergency management policy is the Emergency Operations Board (EOB). The board approves citywide policies, plans, and major initiatives related to emergency management, and provides strategic-level guidance to EMD. The permanent chair of the EOB is the Chief of Police. Other members include the General Manager (or other chief executive) from the departments listed below.\n\nFire                                                    Information Technology Agency\nLos Angeles World Airports         Personnel\nBuilding and Safety                       Recreation and Parks\nCity Administrative Officer           Transportation\nEmergency Management            Water and Power\nGeneral Services                             Board of Public Works\nHarbor (Port of LA)                         Chief Legislative Analyst\n\nFirst Responders and Operational Departments\n\nEffective disaster response requires a rapid, citywide response, which includes both first responders from the Police Department and Fire Department, as well as departments that normally manage public works, neighborhood services, and business operations.\n\nDuring emergency and non-emergency periods, all City departments have their own unique emergency planning and response roles, and are responsible for being ready to fulfill their emergency response responsibilities. For example, the Recreation and Parks Department is the City’s designated mass shelter and care manager, and will convert its facilities to care for residents after a disaster. The Bureau of Engineering provides access to vital records such as infrastructure plans and performs infrastructure damage assessments. The Animal Services Department helps law enforcement officers and firefighters with the evacuation of animals.\n\nCertain City departments have their own emergency planning units, and their own operations centers, known as Department Operations Centers (DOC). Departments that maintain dedicated emergency management teams and DOCs include the Police Department, Fire Department, Recreation and Parks, Transportation, and Los Angeles World Airports. These units coordinate with and support the central EOC during an activation, in addition to facilitating department-level response activities and communication.\n\nEMD Organization and Budget\n\nEMD is a relatively small department. The department is organized into five divisions, each responsible for a different element of the department’s emergency management mission. Those divisions include:\n\nAdministration and Finance;\nPlanning and Resilience;\nOperations and Training;\nCommunity Preparedness and Engagement; and\nInnovation and Development.\n\nIn Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-22, total EMD funding was $6,076,554, and the department was authorized for 30 employees. Total funding for FY 2022-23 is $7,305,737, and the department is authorized for 29 employees. The FY 2022-23 increase is primarily the result of additional funding for indirect expenses.\n\nThe City’s investment in emergency preparedness is slightly below that of peer jurisdictions, with some exceptions. New York City and San Francisco have much larger disaster preparedness budgets, but those jurisdictions are consolidated city-county governments, meaning the entities provide both county and city services. In Los Angeles, the City of Los Angeles and the County of Los Angeles are separate entities.\n\nThe chart below shows the City of Los Angeles emergency preparedness budget and how it compares to select peer cities. These are the figures reported in the adopted FY2021-22 budgets of each city.\n\nThe majority of EMD’s workforce are Emergency Management Coordinators, but Project Coordinators, Management Analysts, and employees in other classifications also support the department’s programs. Like many City departments, EMD has struggled to remain adequately staffed due to budget, hiring, and retention challenges. As of September 2022, EMD had five vacancies, which was an improvement compared to the 10 vacancies it had at the beginning of the year.\n\nEMD’s support for the City’s COVID-19 response has also strained the department’s operational capacity. The EOC has been activated since March 2020. EOC staffing requirements, coupled with COVID-19 workload increases, have contributed to employee burnout concerns. EMD reports that these capacity constraints have forced the department to scale back or delay some of its emergency preparedness activities compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. EMD resource constraints are a factor for many of the issues identified in this report.\n\nEmergency Management Laws, Regulations, and Standards\n\nThere are several laws, regulations, and guidelines that provide the framework for the City’s emergency management apparatus, and the organization and operations of EMD. These laws and standards dictate the types of plans, and disaster response systems that the City should have in place, and how federal, state, and local agencies should assist one another. The table below provides a high-level summary of this framework.\n\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\tNIMS is a standardized FEMA system that guides all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations and the private sector to work together to prevent, protect against, and respond to incidents. NIMS describes optimal operational systems and structures, and establishes recommended preparedness standards for resource management, command and coordination, and communications and information management.  \nStandardized Emergency Management System (SEMS)\tSEMS is the State of California’s standardized emergency response system. The system, which is consistent with NIMS, facilitates intergovernmental coordination across state and local agencies, as well as the management of costs related to mutual aid.\nRobert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Services Act\tThe Stafford Act is a federal law establishing programs and processes that allow the federal government to provide disaster assistance to states, local governments, tribal nations, individuals, and qualified nonprofit organizations.\nCalifornia Emergency Services Act\tThe California Emergency Services Act is a state law that promotes the preparedness of state agencies. The law standardizes the state’s emergency response system, and establishes the Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) within the Governor’s Office.\nLos Angeles Administrative Code Division 8, Chapter 3\tThe Los Angeles Administrative Code centralizes the direction and control of City disaster planning and response by describing powers and authorities, and establishing the EOO and EOB.\nMayoral Executive Directives (EDs)\tA series of EDs published in 2011 and 2012 establish citywide emergency management policies, as well as the specific responsibilities of EMD, other departments, and employees that work in the EOC. The directives include ED 15 (Emergency Management, 2011), ED 16 (Disaster Service Workers, 2011), ED 17 (Emergency Operations Center, 2011), ED 18 (National Incident Management System, 2011), ED 19 (Mayor’s Emergency Response Council, 2011), and ED 23 (Individuals with Disabilities and Functional Needs, 2012).\n\nFederal and state emergency preparedness standards consistently emphasize the need for jurisdictions to develop policies and plans that reflect local conditions, hazards, and population needs. While those standards provide guidelines for planning, coordination, and response, they tend to be less prescriptive than local policies and plans. According to EMD, Los Angeles City officials plan to update Executive Directives for emergency management based on lessons learned from past emergencies, and to better reflect changes in City emergency operations since the directives were established, but the timeline for these revisions is not yet finalized.\n\nPREPARING FOR EXISTING AND EMERGING RISKS\n\nDevelopment of emergency plans and assessments that ensure the City has the ability to respond to the unique hazards facing the Los Angeles area is extremely important. EMD has developed a comprehensive set of citywide, hazard-specific, and functional emergency plans. The development of these plans helps to support the City’s overall emergency readiness.\n\nHowever, maintaining up-to-date plans is a challenge given the department’s competing priorities, and new planning efforts are needed to ensure the City is prepared for emerging risks like cybersecurity and climate change. In addition, EMD currently lacks the capacity to conduct technical reviews of individual department plans, which hinders its ability to evaluate the adequacy of departments’ emergency response and operations continuity plans.\n\nLocal Hazard Mitigation Plan\n\nThe federal government requires jurisdictions that receive federal disaster preparedness funds to develop a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP). The City’s most recent LHMP, which was developed and published by EMD in January 2018, examines and documents both natural and manmade hazards that pose a risk to the City. The plan specifically evaluates potential risks, major past hazard events, local geography and environmental conditions, and community demographics, among other factors.\n\nThe 2018 LHMP concluded that there are numerous hazards facing the City, each requiring unique planning and analysis. The chart below lists the natural and manmade hazards identified in the plan. Natural hazards are ranked based on the risks associated with the hazard, and an analysis of the potential for adverse impact on people, property, and the economy. Manmade hazards are not ranked.\n\nThe results of the 2018 LHMP highlight the need for a methodical, risk-based emergency planning program. EMD plans to update the LHMP in 2023, consistent with federal requirements to update the plan every five years. According to EMD, the upcoming LHMP will have a greater emphasis on climate change and climate-induced hazards to ensure compliance with updated FEMA’s revised LHMP guidance.\n\nCitywide Emergency Operations Plan and Annexes\n\nConsistent with FEMA guidelines and ED 15 (Emergency Management, 2011), EMD maintains a citywide Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). The most recent EOP was published in November 2018. The EOP establishes the overall response strategy and roles and responsibilities for the EOO, EOC, City departments, and the Los Angeles region’s broader emergency management community. The EOP is approved by the EOB, City Council, and Mayor.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the EOP is to outline how the City will respond and the actions it will take in the aftermath of a disaster in order to save human life, meet the basic needs of the community, and protect property, critical infrastructure, and the environment. The EOP provides guidelines and protocols in several key areas, including, but not limited to:\n\nmobilization of emergency services that are to be provided by City departments;\nmethods for carrying out emergency operations and the process for rendering or receiving mutual aid;\na description of the system for providing public information;\nEOC activation and EOO division functions; and\ncontinuity planning guidelines to ensure uninterrupted government operations.\n\nThe EOP is considered the base plan describing fundamental systems and policies. Supplementing the plan is a series of supporting annexes. The role EOP annexes is described in the following section.\n\nEOP Annexes\n\nEOP annexes are issue-specific plans developed jointly by EMD and the City departments with responsibilities related to the annex issue area. These annexes contain planning information covering concepts of operations, roles and responsibilities, procedures facilitating rapid response, interdepartmental coordination protocols, intergovernmental coordination protocols, and preparedness activities which are to be implemented in advance of any potential incident.\n\nAnnexes are to be used by departments when developing their department-level Standard Operating Procedures, as it is ultimately the responsibility of each department to develop operating procedures for their tactical response roles. EMD has developed a total of 40 annexes and supplemental annex appendices. There are two types of annexes – hazard specific and functional. Hazard specific annexes outline plans for specific types of incidents, whereas functional annexes outline operational or business management functions which would be applied to most disaster types.\n\nThe following chart contains examples of hazard specific and functional annexes developed by EMD and its partners. See Appendix A for a list of all EOP annexes.\n\nCurrent Planning Gaps \n\nOverall, EMD has developed a comprehensive set of citywide plans and support annexes, resulting in a generally strong level of planning coverage across the broad spectrum of disaster risks facing the City. The EOP and its annexes address most of the hazards identified in the LHMP, including for several high-risk hazards such as earthquakes, adverse weather, and wildland/urban interface fires.\n\nHowever, there are planning gaps that EMD needs to address to ensure the City is prepared for new and emerging risks. Existing plans do not address two hazards identified in the LHMP, despite the risks related to those hazards increasing in recent years.\n\nCyberattacks and Space Weather\tCyberattacks are malicious crimes which attempt to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or communications networks. Cyberattack motivations and methods vary, and may be perpetrated by individuals, criminal organizations, or foreign governments. Space weather is variations in the space environment that can influence the performance of technology used on earth. The recent cyberattack impacting Los Angeles Unified School District systems highlights the ongoing cybersecurity risk.\nSpecial Event Incidents\tSpecial events are activities on public or private property that affect the ordinary use of public spaces or public rights-of-way, and will require extraordinary levels of City services. These can include festivals, sporting events, parades, conventions and summits. Special events are susceptible to terrorism, civil unrest, and transportation disruptions.\n\nThere are three additional LHMP hazards where no annex or dedicated plan currently exists, but EMD reports the consequences associated with those hazards are at least partially addressed by existing plans or programs.\n\nClimate Change and Sea Level Rise\tClimate change is the long-term warming of the earth’s climate, which is having an ongoing impact on natural ecosystems and weather. Climate change increases the likelihood and severity of weather-related disasters. The increase in global temperatures is melting ice sheets and glaciers, causing oceans and sea levels to rise. Annexes/annex appendices associated with this hazard include: Adverse Weather; Urban Flooding; Logistics Distribution; and Logistics Food and Potable Water.\nDrought\tDrought is a decrease in natural water supplies, leading to water shortages that cause health, quality of life, and economic concerns. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has reported that 97.5% of California is experiencing severe drought. Annexes/annex appendices associated with this hazard include: Adverse Weather; Urban Flooding; Logistics Distribution; and Logistics Food and Potable Water.\nHigh-Rise / High Occupancy Building Fire\tHigh-rise and high occupancy building fires are fires that exceed the aerial reach of fire department equipment, which is typically 75 feet or seven to eight stories. These fires are especially dangerous because it makes rescues and extinguishing the fires much more difficult. Annexes/annex appendices associated with this hazard include: Brushfire; Communication; Emergency Alert and Warning; Evacuation; Public Information; Local Assistance Center; Mass Care and Sheltering; and Recovery.\n\n\nIn addition to the above hazards identified in the Hazard Mitigation Plan, the City must consider the needs of the unhoused population, which is one of the most vulnerable groups in the City. Unhoused people, particularly those experiencing conditions such as mental illness, substance abuse, and physical disabilities, may find it difficult to prepare for disasters, and cope with the resulting hardships. They are also less likely to have the ability to safely evacuate an area. It is important that the City develop inclusive disaster plans that protect people experiencing homelessness, and work closely with other local jurisdictions and homeless services providers to ensure the needs of unhoused populations are met during emergencies.\n\nThe current gaps in hazard planning may impact the City’s ability to effectively respond to certain emergencies, or reduce the City’s overall efficiency during an incident. The City faces many challenges as it moves into the future, including climate change, a worsening homelessness crisis, and an increase in cyber threats against government institutions. The region is also set to host a series of high-profile events in upcoming years, including the Olympics and the World Cup. EMD must continue to evaluate the risks associated with these hazards and events and either develop new annexes, or incorporate plans into existing annexes.\n\nEMD is planning to update the citywide EOP and annexes in 2023 with assistance from an emergency management consultant. The project will be funded by the Urban Area Security Initiative, which is a FEMA program that supports enhanced regional preparedness and capabilities in designated high-threat, high-density areas.\n\nPlan Update Cycle\n\nUntil February 2022, EMD’s policy was to review and update the citywide EOP and the EOP annexes every two years. However, EMD struggled to maintain this update cycle due to the number of annexes currently in place, and the staffing resources required to conduct the assessment. EMD has not updated the citywide EOP or most of the annexes since 2018.  If the two-year planning cycle were still in place, all but one of the annexes (Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Annex) would be past due for an update.\n\nMaintaining current, effective plans is necessary, but the current update goals may not be realistic. The department should establish a new emergency plan update cycle. This could include developing a risk-based update cycle, where annex update cycles would vary based on need or hazard severity. For example, an annex related to technology, where risks and capabilities change rapidly, would be updated more frequently than an annex related to food distribution, an issue less susceptible to rapid change.\n\nFEMA’s Comprehensive Preparedness Guide, which serves as FEMA’s best practices report for emergency plan development, recommends that emergency managers coordinate with executive-level managers and subject matter experts to develop a standardized plan maintenance, review, and update cycle, but does not recommend a specific timeline. EMD intends to establish a revised plan maintenance cycle next year as part of the Urban Area Security Initiative-funded emergency plan update initiative.\n\nDepartment Emergency Plans and Continuity Plans\n\nIn addition to the citywide plans that EMD develops, City departments are responsible for developing and implementing two plans – a Departmental Emergency Plan (DEP) and a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). The formats of DEPs and COOPs are generally consistent across departments, and are developed based on templates provided by EMD. The plans are to be reviewed and updated annually, per ED 15 (Emergency Management, 2011) requirement.\n\nDEPs detail department response plans for executing essential mission critical operations during an emergency, and maintaining the safety of employees and the public. Information contained in DEPs includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\npotential hazards that threaten department operations, facilities, and assets;\nemployee, building, hazardous materials, and fire prevention plans;\ndepartment emergency response roles and functions;\nsupport for citywide emergency response operations;\nEOC and DOC (if applicable) roles and support; and\ndisaster recovery plans.\n\nCOOPs supplement DEPs, and serve as a guide for the restoration of essential functions within 24 hours of an emergency. COOPs tend to focus more on the preservation and continuity of internal services. Information contained in COOPs includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nidentification of essential internal functions;\nidentification of minimum essential personnel to sustain critical department functions;\nestablishment of orders of succession and delegations of authority;\nidentification and preservation of essential records and systems; and\nidentification of backup facilities and supplies.\n\nOver the past several years, departments have generally been able to comply with DEP and COOP submission requirements. However, EMD has not been able to accomplish full compliance by departments. Annual submission rates for the plans since 2017 have been between approximately 75% to 90%. The chart below shows the DEP and COOP submission rates across all City departments between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAccording to EMD, the quality of DEP and COOP plans submitted by departments can vary. Departments that have their own emergency management units or Emergency Management Coordinators on staff benefit from having professional emergency management subject matter expertise within the department. However, smaller departments and departments with a more limited disaster response role are likely to assign DEP and COOP preparation to staff as a collateral administrative duty.\n\nEMD’s Planning and Resilience Division is responsible for management and review of City department emergency plans. As of March 2022, three of the division’s four positions were vacant, excluding management. EMD reported that the department has been unable to conduct technical reviews of department plans, and unable to provide an adequate level of technical assistance to departments that require it. City officials outside of EMD also said that City departments, particularly those that are smaller, would benefit from additional planning support.\n\nDuring the 2020 planning cycle, departments also submitted COVID-19 Department Reconstitution Plans. The reconstitution plans detail operational changes supporting the continued administration of essential services and employee safety protocols specific to the COVID-19 environment. Departments could submit reconstitution plan updates in 2021 and 2022. COVID-19 Department Reconstitution Plans added to the plan development and review workload for EMD and City departments.\n\nUntil EMD has sufficient capacity to conduct comprehensive DEP and COOP plan reviews, EMD should consider developing an interdepartmental working group, where staff responsible for planning across all departments have the opportunity to collaborate, share best practices, and provide cross departmental planning assistance. Collaborative efforts could boost the quality of department plans and departments’ overall readiness, especially if emergency management specialists outside of EMD participate.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo improve the efficiency of emergency planning programs and expand planning coverage, EMD should:\n\nUpdate existing EOP annexes or establish new annexes to include plans for cyberattacks and space weather, special event incidents, climate change and sea level rise, drought, high-rise / high occupancy building fires, unhoused populations, and any other risk area not yet fully addressed by existing plans.\nRevise the EOP annex update cycle and consider a tiered cycle in which annex update schedules are based on the associated level of risk.\nDevelop an interdepartmental planning working group, or similar program, in which departments collaborate and provide peer-to-peer planning assistance.\nPRIORITIZING TRAINING, EXERCISES AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\n\nEmergency management training and exercises that test capabilities and preparations help to enhance employee knowledge of the City’s disaster plans and strategies. Training and exercises also improve emergency managers’ and responders’ ability to make informed, smart decisions when managing disaster response operations. Employee training and EOC responder readiness is a shared responsibility between EMD and departments.\n\nEMD’s ongoing support for the City’s COVID-19 response has hindered its ability to maintain a robust training program for City employees and EOC responders. To address this, EMD should work with departments to improve its tracking of employee training, emergency management certifications, employee skills, and departments’ ability to provide qualified employees for prescribed EOC responsibilities. The department should also improve its processes for tracking program improvement recommendations developed following exercises and EOC activations.\n\nTraining and Exercises\n\nED 17 (Emergency Operations Center, 2011) and the Los Angeles Administrative Code designate EMD as the lead agency for coordinating and administering emergency preparedness training for City employees. Although the directive and code do not specify training requirements other than EOC preparedness and operation, the department’s goal is to provide training across multiple hazard types and operational scenarios.\n\nAccording to EMD, the department is constrained in its ability to administer both training and emergency response exercises. EMD’s Operations and Training Division is responsible for both EOC operations and training programs. The COVID-19 pandemic required the Operations and Training division to shift staffing resources away from training and exercise programs in order to support the prolonged activation of the EOC, as well as the needs of City departments throughout the pandemic. According to EMD, the department is still able to provide foundational emergency management training, and should be able to expand its offering as the pandemic subsides.\n\nEMD records indicate that from January 2020 through May 2022, the department has administered seven different training courses for EOC responders and other City employees with emergency management responsibilities. EMD administered training on EOC management and the City’s virtual emergency operations application on an annual basis. EMD offered training courses and seminars for the following:\n\nEOC management and operations;\nVeoci virtual emergency operations center software;\nNotify LA (emergency public notification system);\nEOC geographic information systems;\npost-earthquake assessments;\nhealth and human services functions; and\ntsunami response.\n\nEMD has also been limited in its ability to administer disaster response exercises. Exercises offer jurisdictions an opportunity to test plans, procedures, and capabilities in a safe, controlled environment. Entities can learn valuable lessons about their strengths, weaknesses, and capacity and resource gaps. From 2016 through 2019, prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, EMD administered 11 exercises. Topics covered by exercise events during this period included EOC activation, cybersecurity, medical points of distribution, and brush fires, among others. From January 2020 through May 2022 EMD administered four exercise events. Those events included:\n\nMass care full scale exercise;\nComplex coordinated terrorist attack functional exercise;\nDefense Support of Civil Authorities tabletop exercise; and\nDefense Support of Civil Authorities summit.\n\nEMD is currently developing a new training and exercise program known as the Integrated Preparedness Plan (IPP). According to EMD, the new plan will allow the department and its partners to integrate preparedness and planning reviews with training and exercises to provide for a more comprehensive hazard preparation process. Under IPP, each year EMD will identify a high-risk hazard. For each selected hazard, EMD will:\n\nassess core response capabilities and information systems readiness;\nassess applicable policies, plans and procedures;\nassess staffing capabilities and needs;\nassess equipment requirements and needs; and\nidentify or develop training opportunities to address skills requirements.\n\nThe IPP for 2022-2024 is currently under development. Under the draft plan, EMD has selected tsunamis as the hazard of focus for 2022. The department plans to finalize the IPP sometime in 2023. EMD will also continue to administer its core training courses for EOC responders.\n\nEmployee Credentialing\n\nEmployee credentialing is the certification of an employee’s qualifications and training for disaster response roles. In the State of California, credentialing standards are tied to FEMA’s National Qualification System, which describes the components of an employee qualification and certification system and defines processes for certifying the qualifications of incident management personnel.\n\nThe ultimate goal of a credentialing program is to ensure employees are qualified and prepared for their EOC or DOC responsibilities. Credentialing also facilitates the sharing of personnel resources across jurisdictions during an emergency because credentialed employees will have baseline incident command qualifications and knowledge regardless of the location or disaster type. Credential types for EOC positions vary based on specialty and the level of responsibility for that position.\n\nED 17 (Emergency Operations Center, 2011) establishes City standards for EOC organization, operations, and staffing. With regard to credentialing, the directive requires EMD to develop a standardized, position specific training and credentialing program for positions within the EOC. The directive further requires City departments to provide trained and credentialed personnel to fulfill EOC duties during an EOC activation.\n\nEMD Credentialing Standards\n\nIn January 2020, shortly before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, EMD issued a citywide policy officially adopting the Cal OES California Specialized Training Institute (CSTI) EOC Credentialing Program as its credentialing standard. CSTI establishes credentialing qualification and training standards for the State of California, issues credentials, and delivers training in areas such emergency management disaster mitigation, crisis communications, terrorism, and hazardous materials safety. City employees that meet training and experience requirements, and are sponsored by their department, are eligible for CSTI credentials.\n\nEMD continues to offer its own EOC training that is consistent with the state’s credentialing standards. Prior to 2020, EMD’s in-house employee training program did not support state credentialing requirements. Though not an official policy, EMD’s goal is for departments to maintain a bench of four credentialed employees for designated departmental positions in the EOC to ensure an adequate level of coverage during activations. This is because activations often require multiple shifts, and employees may not be able to report for EOC duties during a major disaster.\n\nTracking Employee Credentialing and Qualifications\n\nDepartments are responsible for maintaining a cadre of credentialed, qualified employees for EOC service. EMD does not maintain a list or information for credentialed City employees, nor does it have a list of employees that departments have identified as EOC responders. As a result, the City lacks full assurance that EOC staff are qualified for their roles, or that departments are able to provide an adequate level of staffing coverage.\n\nInadequate EOC position staffing can hinder the center’s effectiveness during an emergency. For example, in one EOC after-action report developed after a 2017 wildfire, EMD determined that a department responsible for staffing the Geographic Information Systems Unit was unable to provide employees with the appropriate technical skills. Skills gaps resulted in slower than necessary geographic information systems analysis, which ultimately decreased the efficiency of the EOC Planning Section.\n\nAccording to EMD officials, it is not feasible for many departments to have four credentialed employees for each EOC role, nor is it necessary for a person to be credentialed to successfully fulfill lower level EOC positions. However, it is important that EMD have sufficient information about department EOC responders to ensure operational readiness. EMD should work with departments to develop EOC responder rosters with information about employees’ credentials and skills. EMD should also continue to work with departments to proactively identify department positions or classifications that are suitable for EOC roles, regardless of credentialing status.\n\nAfter-Action Reporting\n\nED 17 (Emergency Operations Center, 2011) requires EMD to publish after-action reports (AARs) for EOC activations. AARs summarize significant incident events, lessons learned, and opportunities for improvement. The AARs include improvement plans, which detail specific recommendations for EMD and other City departments with EOC or emergency management duties.\n\nWhen the City activates the EOC, the activation can fall under one of three activation categories, depending on the seriousness of the emergency. The complexity of each activation can vary widely.\n\nLevel 3 is the lowest activation level. All required EOC positions are staffed by EMD employees. Examples of incident types likely to fall under this category include weather events, smaller local events, and pre-planned special events.\nLevel 2 is for more serious, unplanned incidents. EOC positions are staffed by multiple City departments and outside agencies. Examples of incident types likely to fall under this category include moderate earthquakes, major fires and weather events, and incidents requiring a multi-departmental response.\nLevel 1 is for major disasters. EOC positions are staffed by multiple City departments and outside agencies. Examples of incident types likely to fall under this category include major earthquakes or similar mass casualty events requiring a response from multiple City departments and outside agencies.\n\nEMD’s development and publication of AARs has been somewhat inconsistent. From January 2016 through May 2022, there have been a total of 43 EOC activations, but the department has developed 20 AARs. Of the 20 AARs, several are completed or near completion but still in draft. The chart below summarizes the AAR status for EOC activations, by activation level. See Appendix B for a list of EOC activations from January 2016 through May 2022.\n\nAccording to EMD, AARs are not always necessary for EOC activations because some activations are routine, or have a monitoring mission rather than a response role. However, the department should clarify its policies for AAR development and publication, as there are outstanding reports across all three activation levels, with each level requiring differing levels of coordination and department involvement.\n\nImprovement Plan Monitoring\n\nED 17 (Emergency Operations Center, 2011) also requires EOC AARs to include specific recommendations for improvement. In addition to Executive Directive requirements to develop AARs for EOC activations, EMD also develops AARs with recommendations following many exercises. AAR recommendations can apply to any City department, as well as some external government agencies. Continuously identifying and addressing programmatic weaknesses based on lessons learned from real world incidents and exercises helps the City improve its overall readiness.\n\nEMD is responsible for coordinating and tracking improvement plan recommendation implementation. However, EMD does not maintain a comprehensive recommendation tracking record, and currently does not have a formal process for regularly tracking the status of past recommendations. As a result, the department lacks assurance that identified weaknesses related to policies, plans, EOC operations, and employee readiness are addressed.\n\nEMD last conducted an ad-hoc recommendation implementation assessment that culminated in 2019, covering 359 recommendations from 2013 through 2019. The recommendation information was recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. While the recommendation database contained information about the implementation actions of departments and the status of recommendations, the completeness of the database, as well as the lack of standardized nomenclature regarding the status of each recommendation, makes analysis difficult. For example, the database contained 97 different recommendation status types.\n\nBased on our review of the 359 recommendations and associated status information for each recommendation, we estimate that 185 (52%) of the recommendations had been implemented at the time of EMD’s 2019 assessment. The table below summarizes our assessment of EMD’s recommendation records. This assessment required several judgmental determinations due to limited, conflicting, or incomplete information in the tracker.\n\nThe recommendation implementation rate of 52% observed during the 2019 assessment, as well as the lack of recommendation tracking since 2019, indicates that a large number of deficiencies are going unaddressed. According to EMD, the department was unable to monitor recommendation implementation after 2019, and many of the recommendations in the tracker are likely no longer applicable.\n\nEMD should work with other departments to develop a new procedure for following up on improvement plan recommendations, and identify opportunities to automate the collection and management of recommendation data to reduce the likelihood of human error and facilitate analysis. According to EMD, it is in the early stages of assessing the feasibility of tracking recommendations within a module of the Veoci virtual emergency operations center application used by the department to facilitate EOC operations.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo ensure City staff and departments are prepared to support EOC and emergency response operations, EMD should:\n\n4. Require City departments to develop and report to EMD on a regular basis a roster of designated, qualified responders likely to fulfill EOC duties during an activation. Roster information should include credential status, position classification, relevant skills, and relevant training.\n5. To the greatest extent possible, expand hazard-specific training opportunities and exercise events for City employees.\n6. Establish a formal policy addressing AAR development, publication, and dissemination.\n7. Establish a formal policy addressing the implementation and monitoring of improvement plan recommendations.\n\nMANAGING DISASTER RESPONSE ASSETS AND PARTNERSHIPS\n\nResource limitations and supply chain constraints experienced by most government entities during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the importance of asset management, logistics, and procurement planning. Depending on the emergency, the City departments will need access to goods and services ranging from personal protective equipment like gloves and masks, to heavy equipment for search and rescue operations, to cones and signs for traffic control.\n\nThe City’s General Services Department (GSD), working in coordination with EMD, serves as the lead department responsible for managing assets that are set aside for disasters, or can be repositioned to support disaster response operations. GSD manages facilities, equipment, maintenance and supply chain services for City departments, and acts as the City’s lead purchasing agent. GSD and EMD have developed comprehensive logistics and procurement plans, and are working to expand emergency supply stockpiles. However, GSD and EMD should work together during non-emergency periods to evaluate supply and equipment needs for major disasters like a catastrophic earthquake or biological attack. Opportunities also exist to improve coordination with local partners to facilitate resource and information sharing.\n\nLogistics and Procurement Planning\n\nPurchasing and managing supplies and equipment that will be deployed following a disaster is a key element of a city’s emergency response program. Managing disaster response assets can be challenging, particularly across a large organization like the City of Los Angeles. Jurisdictions must find an appropriate balance between maintaining a sufficient level of supplies and equipment on hand, and the ability to quickly and efficiently procure goods and services.\n\nFEMA’s NIMS standards recommend jurisdictions have several resource options, including stockpiles, contracts, mutual aid agreements with other government agencies, and the ability to redirect existing resources. Consistent with FEMA planning guidelines, EMD, in coordination with GSD and other departments, has developed a comprehensive EOP annex for logistics that covers resource management and coordination during an emergency.\n\nThe EOP Logistics Annex (2018) contains plans for communication, information systems management, contracting and procurement, asset management and control, staging and distribution, intergovernmental coordination, and special issues, such as the management of fuel, food, water, donations, and volunteers. Supplementing the annex are six appendices that detail specific plans and protocols in these areas. Those appendices were published in 2018, and include:\n\ndistribution management;\ndonation management;\nfacilities;\nfood and potable water;\nfuel; and\ntransportation.\n\nIn addition to citywide plans contained in the EOP and its supplemental plans, GSD’s DEP, COOP, and the GSD Logistics Guide contain procedures for logistics and inventory management. During an emergency, departments coordinate with GSD via the EOC to determine whether a necessary resource is in stock. If the requested item is unavailable, GSD either orders the supply from the existing vendor pool or establishes a new contract.\n\nDisaster Response Asset Information\n\nDuring an emergency, departments coordinate via the EOC to determine whether resources are available through GSD or other departments. However, information about available disaster response assets is spread out across multiple systems and departments. Below is a high-level summary of key inventory data sources.\n\nConsumable and disposable emergency supplies (i.e. drinking water, personal protective equipment, sandbags, etc.) information is housed in the inventory module of the citywide Financial Management System.\nVehicle and heavy equipment information is housed in the inventory module of the Financial Management System, or the citywide Fleet Vehicle Management System. Operating departments maintain additional information related to the use and status of vehicles and heavy equipment under their control.\nSupplies and equipment that departments acquire for their own tactical response operations are the responsibility of the acquiring department. Those departments maintain their own inventory control and data protocols.\n\nThe decentralized nature of the City’s disaster response asset data highlights the importance of EOC coordination activities. To support the rapid, efficient identification and analysis of resource information, FEMA recommends jurisdictions identify resources in accordance with NIMS resource typing standards. NIMS resource typing definitions help to create a common language across government agencies for supplies, equipment, facilities, and response teams. NIMS typing definitions are most helpful when a jurisdiction requests assistance from outside agencies, as it streamlines resource sharing.\n\nThe GSD inventory system is a module within the City’s Financial Management System. This system does not support NIMS resource typing definitions, and neither GSD nor EMD currently maintain an inventory of NIMS typed resources. ED 18 (National Incident Management System, 2011) requires City departments to inventory assets in conformance with NIMS Resource Typing Definitions.\n\nGSD Plans for a New Disaster Supply Stockpile\n\nDuring the City’s COVID-19 response, the City relied heavily on GSD procurement services to obtain necessary supplies and services. According to GSD, the department sought to leverage the City’s purchasing power and existing supplier relationships to fulfill departments’ requests as quickly as possible. Relying heavily on procurement services when responding to a disaster is not necessarily a bad strategy, and jurisdictions must develop procurement and inventory strategies that meet their specific needs. FEMA’s NIMS standards note that resource stockpiling can create issues concerning shelf life and durability, but acquiring resources just in time also has potential pitfalls, as the timely procurement of resources cannot be guaranteed.\n\nThe City must ensure it has multiple options for securing resources during an emergency, which includes having sufficient supply and equipment levels on hand. This is particularly important for large scale disasters impacting multiple jurisdictions at the same time, which can strain supply chains, contribute to resource scarcity, and create a difficult procurement environment. For example, during the City’s COVID-19 response, the City was unable to procure goods and services under its primary catastrophic incident response and recovery services contract.\n\nThe professional services contract, which went into effect in 2020 and was managed by the Mayor’s Office of Public Safety, established an emergency management and logistics consulting firm as an on-call vendor for the City. The contract required the vendor to maintain the ability to mobilize operations within 24 hours of a City order, and provide the following goods and services:\n\nfood and water;\nmedical supplies;\nelectrical power;\ntemporary shelters and portable public sanitation facilities;\ntransportation;\ntactical security; and\ndebris removal.\n\nCOVID-19 was a unique disaster simultaneously impacting the entire country, seriously stressing global and national supply chains. The vendor was ultimately unable to deliver goods and services to the City under the contract, highlighting the inherent risks of relying too heavily on outside firms to provide timely goods and services.\n\nBased on lessons learned from the City’s response to COVID-19 and other incidents, GSD is planning to establish a new, dedicated disaster supply stockpile. Under the three-year plan, GSD will work with departments to identify disaster supply needs and gradually build stockpiles. The chart below summarizes GSD’s stockpile plan.\n\nGSD estimates the total cost to develop the stockpile will be $7.7 million over three years. The City Council allocated $72,000 in the FY2022-23 budget for GSD’s first year phase. Full implementation of the plan is subject to funding availability in the future.\n\nResource Capability Planning\n\nFEMA’s NIMS Resource Management Guide recommends government agencies conduct a periodic supply gap analysis that identifies resource needs and shortfalls. Should an agency identify resource shortfalls, the organization can address those through a variety of initiatives, which can include the budget and procurement processes, mutual aid agreements, memoranda of understanding, contractual service agreements, or business partnerships.\n\nAccording to GSD, it conducts regular cycle counts of supplies and equipment in its warehouses, which includes physical verifications of inventories. The department also conducts a seasonal inventory review of supplies needed for regularly occurring seasonal emergencies, such as brush fires, heavy rain, and extreme heat, as well as non-catastrophic incidents related to natural hazards, public safety, and public health. However, GSD does not regularly assess supply and equipment needs for less frequent, large-scale emergencies, such as a catastrophic earthquake, or a chemical, biological, or radiological event.\n\nFurthermore, EMD is not regularly involved in supply and equipment needs assessments related to GSD inventories, limiting EMD’s resource planning visibility, and increasing the risk that the City will be overly reliant on rapid procurement or assistance from outside agencies in the future. A more comprehensive, hazard-specific gap analysis initiative among GSD, EMD, and other emergency responders would improve the City’s readiness moving forward.\n\nMutual Aid and Interagency Coordination\n\nThe City of Los Angeles falls within the County of Los Angeles Operational Area, which serves as the regional planning coordinator under federal and state incident management systems. The City is under County Disaster Management Area H, and is the sole jurisdiction in the area. Under this system, the County serves as the intermediate level of government that coordinates and communicates disaster response needs between the 88 cities within its boundaries. The system is established through a joint powers agreement among participating jurisdictions. The City and the County of Los Angeles can also seek assistance from the State of California and the federal government.\n\nIn addition to regional planning areas that facilitate the coordination of aid, formal mutual aid agreements are a valuable tool for jurisdictions by helping them plan for resource shortfalls. Mutual aid agreements are formal agreements that serve as a legal basis for two or more entities to share resources. Mutual aid agreements can include plans to share supplies and equipment, law enforcement resources, fire and rescue teams, or public works crews, among other assets. Mutual aid agreements are beneficial because they describe:\n\nprocedures and controls for resource mobilization (e.g. request, dispatch, and response);\nreimbursement protocols;\ncommunications and data interoperability; and\nliability agreements.\n\nEMD does not currently have any active intergovernmental mutual aid agreements outside of the existing County of Los Angeles Operational Area plan and authorities. However, the department has active aid agreements with two non-governmental organizations – one with the American Red Cross and another with the Salvation Army. Under the aid agreements, the organizations provide:\n\nmass shelter and care for survivors of major disasters;\nsupply logistics and operations support; and\nmanagement support for donations.\n\nAs the City works to develop a new disaster supply stockpile and continues to evaluate the potential impact of local hazards, EMD should work with departments to determine whether any mutual aid agreements are necessary to facilitate resource and response support from partner agencies. Such agreements would be most helpful if the City identifies significant resource gaps during inventory assessments, planning and hazard assessment cycles, or exercises.\n\nCoordination with the County of Los Angeles   \n\nAccording to EMD, its staff works with partners at the County of Los Angeles on an ongoing basis during both emergency and non-emergency periods. However, opportunities exist to formalize the planning and coordination activities between the City and the County.\n\nAn outdated 1994 agreement, known as the Emergency Management Agreement Between the County and the City of Los Angeles, serves as the official coordination guideline between the two entities. The interagency agreement calls for development of a joint procedural guide, shared access to emergency management information systems and communications systems, and dedicated EOC liaisons. Importantly, the agreement also established a formal committee called the Joint City/County of Emergency Management Organization (JCCLA).\n\nIn the past, the JCCLA, which consisted of officials from the County’s Office of Emergency Management, the City’s emergency managers, and other emergency responders from the County and City, would regularly meet to evaluate preparedness, response, and recovery planning efforts and develop recommendations to improve interoperability. According to EMD, the JCCLA has not convened for several years.\n\nCommunity and Private Sector Engagement\n\nThe Los Angeles Administrative Code assigns EMD with the responsibility of educating the public about emergency preparedness. EMD’s primary public education program is Ready Your LA Neighborhood (RYLAN). RYLAN is a community planning program where neighborhoods and residential facility residents can work with EMD to develop a hyperlocal emergency plan.\n\nThe RYLAN program encourages community members to learn about personal and neighborhood preparedness within a structured learning environment. When a neighborhood or a residential community sign-up for the RYLAN program, participants can engage with EMD via an interactive web-based tutorial and training video, or request an in-person presentation from an EMD Emergency Management Coordinator. As a group, participants use a template provided by EMD to develop a neighborhood plan which seeks to accomplish the following:\n\ndesignate neighborhood emergency coordinators and safe gathering sites;\nestablish post-incident safety checklists (e.g. turning off natural gas connections, checking for downed power lines);\nidentify useful equipment and residents with special skills (e.g. first-aid kits, personal protective equipment, fire extinguishers, power tools, radios, medical skills, construction skills);\nidentify individuals that will need special assistance or have special medical needs; and\nestablish basic communications plans so that during an emergency, neighbors can identify individuals that need help.\n\nCommunity preparedness efforts by the City are important because many Angelenos fall into social or socio-economic groups that put them at a disadvantage during a disaster situation. Examples of factors that can put individuals at a disadvantage include living in poverty, not having a car, living in a nursing facility, not having health insurance, and speaking English as a second language, among others. The FEMA National Risk Assessment found that social groups in Los Angeles County have a relatively high level of susceptibility to the adverse impacts of natural hazards. Los Angeles County’s social vulnerability risk rating was higher than 77% of U.S. counties.\n\nAccording to EMD, the RYLAN program initially saw strong levels of community participation. However, staffing constraints and the inability to support in-person planning assistance due to COVID-19 have hindered the department’s ability to reach additional communities. The chart below shows the number of RYLAN plans completed since FY2016-17. EMD worked with communities to complete a high of 141 RYLAN plans in FY2019-20, but the number of plans dropped to zero in FY2020-21 and FY2021-22. EMD said it should be able to conduct more outreach and RYLAN training when staffing improves. EMD plans to improve the RYLAN website and make self-service planning and training tools easier to use. The department should continue to target disadvantaged communities to enhance their disaster resilience.\n\nWhile the RYLAN program focuses on neighborhood and community-based planning, EMD does not currently have a similar private sector engagement program. FEMA recognizes the need for private sector partnerships in its Building Private-Public Partnerships guide, emphasizing that public and private sector organizations are often interdependent on each other for success for both normal business operations, and during an emergency.\n\nExamples of industries that play key roles in supporting government and communities during a disaster period include transportation services, hospitals and medical services providers, utility companies, telecommunications service providers, and grocery and food services companies. FEMA recommends that jurisdictions identify private sector stakeholders that have a major impact on community resilience, and work with those partners to:\n\ndefine the purpose of the partnership and create formal membership agreements;\nassess the shared risks based on the local hazard landscape and other local conditions;\nincrease the resiliency of government agencies and businesses by managing the impact of local hazards and establishing plans for mutual support following a disaster; and\ndevelop plans and response frameworks that allow public and private sector partners to quickly restore community lifelines.\n\nEMD officials plan to expand private sector outreach and collaborate with private sector partners in the future. The department should prioritize the establishment of new private sector partnerships moving forward, and create opportunities for the City’s emergency managers to meet with the business community on a more regular basis.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo improve resource planning and enhance interagency coordination, EMD, in conjunction with GSD and other departments as needed, should:\n\n8. Assess the feasibility of developing a standalone emergency asset inventory that includes FEMA’s NIMS Resource Typing Standards, or integrating the standards into existing inventories.\n9. Conduct a periodic disaster asset gap analysis to identify resource needs for catastrophic, non-seasonal hazards likely to impact the region.\n\nTo improve the availability of critical supplies and equipment during emergencies, the City Council should:\n\n10. Continue its support and funding for GSD’s three-year disaster supply stockpile plan.\n\nTo ensure the City has adequate supplemental support during an emergency, EMD should:\n\n11. Based on a review of asset inventories or the results of a resource gap analysis, determine whether any new mutual aid agreements are needed.\n12. Update the Emergency Management Agreement Between the County and the City of Los Angeles to reflect current operations and coordination needs, and re-establish the Joint City/County of Los Angeles Emergency Management Organization.\n13. Develop a private sector engagement plan which identifies industries and businesses with critical community resilience roles, and establishes partnership strategies addressing the private sector’s role in supporting the disaster response and recovery efforts.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEnsuring that the City is ready and able to protect residents and businesses when facing a disaster is paramount. The City has taken many prudent planning steps, but new plans, training initiatives, and response strategies will be needed to address existing and emerging risks like climate change and cybersecurity. The City must also analyze its resource needs on an ongoing basis and secure the assets it needs to effectively respond, regardless of the size and scope of the incident. We encourage EMD and its partners to implement the recommendations in this report to promote the readiness and resiliency of the City and its communities.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAPPENDICES\n\nAppendix A – List of EOP Annexes and Annex Appendices\n\nAdverse Weather\nBrush Fire\nCBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear)\nCBRN Biological Appendix\nCBRN Chemical Appendix\nCBRN Nuclear Appendix\nCBRN Radiological Appendix\nCivil Disturbance\nCommunications\nCritical Infrastructure\nDam / Reservoir Failure\nDebris Flow\nDebris Management\nEarly Warnings and Notifications\nEarthquake\nEmergency Public Information\nEvacuation\nLocal Assistance Center\nLogistics\nLogistics Donation Management Appendix\nLogistics Distribution Management Appendix\nLogistics Facilities Appendix\nLogistics Food and Potable Water Appendix\nLogistics Fuel Appendix\nLogistics Transportation Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering\nMass Care and Sheltering Health and Medical Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering Large Animal Support Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering Small Animal Support Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering Mass Feeding Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering Traditional Sheltering Appendix\nMass Care and Sheltering Non-Traditional Sheltering Appendix\nMedical Points of Distribution\nOff Airport Major Aircraft Response\nPandemic\nRecovery\nResettlement Processing Center\nTerrorism Prevention and Protection\nTsunami\nUrban Flooding\n\nAppendix B – EOC Activations (January 2016 – May 2022)\n\nEvent\tYear\tActivation Dates\nCOVID-19\t2020-2022\tMarch 16 (2020)-Present\nSuper Bowl LVI\t2022\tFebruary 5-15\nLA Marathon\t2022\tMarch 20\nCathay Manor\t2021\tNovember 1-December 16\nChauvin Verdict\t2021\tApril 20\nPresidential Inauguration\t2021\tJanuary 20\n27th St. Incident\t2021\tJuly 1-16\nLA Marathon\t2021\tNovember 7\nPresidential Election\t2020\tNovember 3\nProtest for Racial Equality\t2020\tMay 30-June 5\nLA Marathon\t2020\tMarch 8\nKobe Memorial\t2020\tFebruary 23\nGetty Fire\t2019\tOctober 28-November 1\nSepulveda Fire\t2019\tOctober 24\nPalisades Fire\t2019\tOctober 21\nSaddleridge Fire\t2019\tOctober 10-12\nMay Day\t2019\tMay 1\nNipsey Hussle Memorial\t2019\tApril 11\nLA Marathon\t2019\tMarch 24\nWinter Storm\t2019\tJanuary 15\nWoolsey Fire\t2018\tNovember 9-14\nWorld Series Game 5\t2018\tOctober 28\nPortola Fire\t2018\tJune 12\nMay Day\t2018\tMay 1\nValley Complex Incident\t2018\tMarch 20-22\nLA Marathon\t2018\tMarch 18\nPOTUS Visit\t2018\tMarch 13\nWinter Storm\t2018\tJanuary 9\nCreek Fire\t2017\tDecember 5-8\nIt Begins Nov 4th Protest\t2017\tNovember 4\nWorld Series\t2017\tNovember 1\nLa Tuna Canyon Fire\t2017\tSeptember 1\nValley Power Outage\t2017\tJune 9\nMay Day\t2017\tMay 1\nLA Marathon\t2017\tMarch 19\nPresidential Inauguration and Adverse Weather\t2017\tJanuary 20-23\nNov 10 Election Protests\t2016\tNovember 10-11\nSand Fire\t2016\tJune 23-24\nUCLA Active Shooter\t2016\tJune 1\nMay Day\t2016\tMay 1\nBrussels Airport / Maelbeek Station Bombings\t2016\tMarch 22\nLA Marathon\t2016\tFebruary 14\nEl Nino Storm Watch 1\t2016\tJanuary 4-7"

      "textofpage": "In July 2019, Controller Galperin released his audit, “Room to Grow: A Framework for Youth Development in Los Angeles,” which reviewed the City of L.A.’s progress in improving the delivery of youth development programming and proposed a new framework for youth development at the City. This follow-up report assesses the City’s progress in implementing those recommendations.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nBACKGROUND\n\nNearly a third of the City’s residents are under the age of 24. Providing young people with access to resources is especially important throughout their developmental stages. Actively participating in safe and enriching programs can help improve self-confidence, increase academic achievement, and promote feelings of safety, belonging, and connectedness.\n\nIn July 2019, we released our report Room to Grow: A Framework for Youth Development in Los Angeles. The report examined the City’s approach to delivering youth programming and found that the City’s piecemeal approach was not unified by a central entity or strategy to guide funding decisions and measure overall impact.\n\nOur report also identified several high-risk groups who are most in need of help. While Los Angeles is home to an array of institutions offering learning and development programs, an increasing number of young Angelenos face barriers that can make it challenging to take advantage of available opportunities. Subject matter experts highlighted several subpopulations that are most at risk of feeling isolated and falling behind—many of the City’s youth fall into these categories. These subpopulations include:\n\nyouth experiencing homelessness;\nyouth in low-income families;\nyouth involved with child welfare or justice systems;\nyouth exposed to violence;\nLGBTQ youth;\nyouth with disabilities;\nimmigrants; and\nEnglish language learners.\n\nDue to the issues outlined above and the importance of ensuring future generations of Angelenos are positioned for success, our office initiated a follow-up review of the City’s implementation of our prior recommendations. This report summarizes our assessment of the City’s efforts in implementing recommendations made in our prior report.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 pandemic on young Angelenos\n\nWhile many aspects of young Angelenos’ daily lives have slowly reverted to their pre-pandemic routine, the impacts of the pandemic continue—and will continue likely into the future. This is especially true for young people who belong to at-risk groups or live in households struggling with poverty.\n\nSeveral studies have raised alarms about the condition of youth mental health resulting from a combination of factors such as grief, loneliness, and disruption. The impacts of this trauma are significant—suicide rates have increased and a growing number of young people have reported contemplating suicide.\nWhile changes in routine and the shift to remote school schedules affected most school-aged youth, existing gaps in academic achievement and access to opportunities have worsened during the last two years. In addition, chronic absenteeism has soared—the Los Angeles Unified School District reported that nearly half of its students missed at least 9% of the 2021-22 academic year.\nDecreases in physical activity have contributed to increasing levels of childhood obesity and associated health risks.\n\nThe City has taken several steps during the pandemic to protect vulnerable youth, such as providing direct financial assistance to low-income households. But the conditions described above further highlight the need for a comprehensive and responsive youth development strategy. Overall, we found that the City has made important progress towards implementing our recommendations, but there is still much more work ahead.\n\nKEY ISSUES FROM 2019 REVIEW\n\nAlthough City departments reported spending more than $175 million on youth programs—which likely did not include the full inventory of programs and costs—our 2019 review found that the City did not have a youth-specific organizational framework. This created several challenges that needed to be resolved in order to ensure high-quality services are available to all young Angelenos.\n\nLack of a centralized entity to guide youth programming and spending\n\nWe found that there was no single entity tasked with carrying out critical initiatives such as establishing citywide youth development goals, monitoring youth outcomes, evaluating programs to ensure efficient service delivery, and improving service equity and inclusion. Generally, each department was responsible for developing their own goals and programs based on their operations and subject matter expertise. This approach made it difficult to measure impact, address specific community needs, and identify service gaps or redundancies.\n\nIn the past, citywide coordination and advocacy was the responsibility of the Commission for Children, Youth, and Their Families. However, this commission was eliminated in 2010 as a result of budgetary constraints. \n\nNo comprehensive strategic or master plan\n\nBoth the National League of Cities and Federal Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs emphasize the need for governments to develop strategic plans to guide their short- and long-term decisions about youth services planning, program development, and funding. Effective strategic plans add value by providing a comprehensive vision, outline needs and available resources, and create a structured plan for implementing successful youth programming.\n\nChallenges accessing youth program opportunities\n\n\nThere is was no single point of entry or information source for residents seeking youth program information; residents needed to navigate multiple department websites or phone numbers. The overall effectiveness of any program is limited if potential participants are unaware of available opportunities.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FOLLOW-UP\n\nOur previous report recommended steps the City should take as it evaluates development and implementation its youth programs. These steps are intended to lay the foundation for a long-term strategy for youth programming decisions. As described below, the City has made important progress—but remains in the early stages on essential components of its reimagined framework. \n\nEstablishment of the Youth Development Department (YDD) is a step toward addressing the service gap left by the elimination of the youth strategy manager and youth commission during the Great Recession. The department is currently led by an Executive Director and also includes a team of seven employees with community engagement, strategic planning, and administration responsibilities. As the City works toward implementing our recommendations, it should support the department’s efforts to build in-house capacity. In addition, the City should consider ways to maximize the value of available resources that are most suited for supporting and interacting with the City’s youth, such as the Department of Recreation and Parks and its facilities.\n\n1.    The City should establish or designate a lead office or department for youth initiatives, including advocacy and citywide youth development strategy.\tStatus: Implemented\n\nIn June 2021, the City passed an ordinance creating YDD. The City established the department to serve as the central agency coordinating youth development and engagement and to ensure youth programing and investments are operating under a unified youth development strategy.\n\nEffective August 2021, YDD was tasked with:\n\nserving as the central public information center to access youth services in the City;\ndeveloping a road map for long-term youth program planning, coordinating with other City departments, regional agencies, and other providers of youth services to develop a Citywide three-year Youth Development Strategic Plan;\nadvising the Mayor and the City Council on youth programs to ensure efficient use of City resources and the greatest return on investment; and\nproviding necessary staffing for the Olivia E. Mitchell LA City Youth Council.\n\nYDD staff noted that they expect the department’s roles and responsibilities to continuously evolve in the department’s early years as the City further explorers how to best serve young Angelenos. For example, during the FY 2022-23 budget development process, the City Council allocated funding to establish a youth protection division within YDD. Staff indicated that responsibilities of the youth protection division will include the development of safety and protection policies for youth utilizing the City’s programs and services. In addition, YDD staff indicated that the City Council is seeking to expand YDD’s responsibilities as outlined in the ordinance in order to more effectively fulfill its responsibilities.\n\n2.    The City should analyze demographic, wellness, and achievement data to examine the specific needs of young Angelenos, and identify areas where programming is falling short of community needs and expectations. \tStatus: In Progress\n\nTarget Date: May 2023\n\nYDD recently awarded a contract to a consulting firm to assist with several initiatives related to youth development and programming. The scope of contracted services includes an assessment of policies and data relative to the City’s youth and identification of gaps between community needs and offered programs. The consultant is also tasked with assessing geographic areas with that are underserved by the existing network of programs.\n\n3.    The City should develop a formal master plan which establishes goals for the City, establishes an implementation plan to achieve those goals, and guides departments as they make investment and operational decisions.\tStatus: In Progress\n\nTarget Date: May 2023\n\nThe consulting engagement described above includes development of a three-year Youth Development Strategic Plan. As outlined in the contract, the plan will be developed at the conclusion of a larger process that includes original research/analysis, reviews of best practices in other jurisdictions, and input from a mix of stakeholders including YDD, the Olivia E. Mitchell LA City Youth Council, elected officials, City departments, youth participants, and community stakeholders.\n\n4.    The City should establish outcome-based performance indicators which measure the City’s progress towards achieving goals, and emphasize both program utilization and program impact.     \tStatus: In Progress\n\nTarget Date: May 2023\n\nYDD’s consultant is tasked with development of performance metrics and performance indicators to assess the annual progress and impact of the newly-developed Strategic Plan. YDD indicated that one of the key goals of the strategic planning process is to assist the department in developing milestones related to measuring participation in youth programs throughout City departments, measurement guidelines to track resources invested and utilized, and performance indicators to assess the success of each program.\n\n5.    The City should explore partnership opportunities and collaborate with key stakeholders to improve programs and maximize the number of young Angelenos benefiting from youth services and opportunities. \tStatus: In Progress\n\nTarget Date: May 2023\n\nThe scope of the consulting contract includes assessing strategies on how YDD can leverage partnerships with regional public and private stakeholders including youth serving community-based organizations, City and County agencies, and private philanthropic partners in coordinating the implementation of the City’s strategic plan. In addition, the contract includes development of recommendations for the establishment, management, and long-term funding of a network of Youth Hubs in the City through a partnership with Recreation and Parks, and other youth serving organizations. The implementation of identified partnership strategies will be a part of the Department’s ongoing work, subject to the City’s annual budget evaluation process.\n\nInternally within the City, YDD established a liaison network throughout most City Departments and throughout the City’s Council Offices. The liaison network will be leveraged in coordinating the delivery of youth programs and related policy development under a unified citywide youth development strategy.\n\nIn May 2022, YDD launched the Earn Learn and Play (ELP) platform. The platform is an awareness campaign with a portal providing centralized access to information on hundreds of free and low-cost recreational and educational youth programs and paid internship opportunities throughout the City.\n\n6.    The City should develop a formal, consistent reporting platform in the form of progress reports or report cards, to allow policymakers, stakeholders, and the public to monitor the well-being of young Angelenos over time.  These reports will allow the City to assess the impact of investments, and should be used to make necessary updates to youth master plans.\tStatus: In Progress\n\nTarget Date: June 2023\n\nYDD’s adopted budget for Fiscal Year 2022-23 includes funding for contractual services to establish a central information platform for accessing City youth programs and services offered by the City. The department notes that the platform will also serve as a reporting portal to track service levels and outcomes across programs and to track the City’s investments on youth programs. The reports will be used to assess the impact of the City’s programs on the City’s youth populations and to help guide the City’s master planning efforts."

This is accomplished through a 24-hour telephone hotline and web-based complaint form, citywide education and training programs, and proactive investigations. The activity of the FWA Unit in 2021 is the subject of this report.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Office of the City Controller’s Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FWA) Unit was established to screen, monitor, and investigate allegations of FWA involving City resources. To support the integrity of City operations, the Unit receives, evaluates, investigates, and reports on FWA allegations that impact City resources. The City’s definitions of Fraud, Waste, and Abuse are outlined below.\n\nDuring 2021, the FWA Unit received 523 cases, an increase of 14% from the 460 cases received in the prior year. The all-time high number of cases received during 2019 was attributed to an enhanced Fraud Awareness Training developed by the FWA Unit, which is part of the City’s required bi-annual training curriculum.\n\nThe FWA Unit has created a refreshed version of the Fraud Awareness Training which was deployed to all Departments citywide in January 2021. This training is a key resource for employees to help them remain knowledgeable about fraud risks and understand how to identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse in their work setting.\n\n2021 CASE OUTCOMES\n\nThe following subsections highlight key outcomes from several substantiated cases for investigations that were conducted by, or in collaboration with, the FWA Unit during 2021. To deter the likelihood of future misconduct, it is critical that City departments administer disciplinary actions that are serious, fair, and in accordance with established policies. We found inconsistencies in the discipline imposed for the type of offense committed, which has a broader impact on the City’s overall risk framework.\n\nViolations or Abuse of City Policy\nThe FWA Unit investigated the use of the Acting Assignment bonus code and identified 305 active employees who had recorded a projected $490,000 of bonus payments exceeding the MOU policy specified one-year time limit. Proper procedure would have been for the department to review whether the Acting Assignment was still needed after the time limit was reached and if so, relieve the employee of their Acting Assignment and in-turn appoint another employee to assume the Acting role who would then receive the bonus payment. This occurred due to a lack of departmental oversight to ensure adherence to MOU requirements, and the inability of the City’s payroll system to automatically detect and restrict the bonus code usage if an employee exceeds the one-year limit. The City is currently working towards implementing a new Human Resources and Payroll (HRP) System that is set to rollout in 2022.\n\nOur findings outlined four specific recommendations to improve oversight of assigned bonuses in accordance with MOU requirements to ensure employees are treated equitably citywide. The recommendations included the responsible departments of the CAO, Personnel, and Controller.\n\nA Recreation and Parks employee was investigated and confirmed to be violating policy by using their position as a Recreation Assistant to gain access to City-owned fields on weekends to host private league baseball games without authorization. The investigation found the employee was running a baseball league and personally benefited by receiving money for hosting the baseball games and even brought in portable toilets for the league to use during the weekends. The employee was terminated as a result of this misconduct.\nConflict of Interest\nA hotline tip alleged that a City employee had a conflict of interest as a committee member of a City administered scholarship. Specifically, the reporting party alleged that the subject allowed a close relative to be awarded an approximately $2,000 scholarship even though the relative did not meet the minimum requirements. During the course of the investigation, the subject admitted that the relative did receive the scholarship even though they did not meet the minimum requirements, agreed to repayment of the funds, and is no longer participating on the scholarship selection committee.\nAn Airport employee was investigated based on multiple allegations of conflict of interest including photographing planes for a social media account during work hours for personal gain. The investigation found the employee did not generate income from the social media account, however the employee was counseled that these activities should be conducted during non-work hours and reinforced the department rules, regulations, and work expectations.\nPayroll Fraud\nAn investigation found that salaried employees at a department had falsified timecards by reporting hours not actually worked resulting in an estimated loss of over $50,000. The salaried employees had maintained a log of “book time”, which is against City policy, to account for hours worked in excess of a regular eight-hour shift to track time that they are not compensated for as a salaried employee. This “book time” would then be used by the employee by falsely recording hours worked on their timecard when in fact the employee was absent. The employees received disciplinary action for violation of the City’s payroll policies and recommendations were addressed with the department.\nA Department of Transportation employee was investigated and confirmed to be working on unauthorized outside employment and falsely reported work absences by using COVID-19 designated leave and sick time, among others. Disciplinary action is pending.\nWaste or Abuse of City Resources\nA hotline tip alleged that the Department of Transportation was wasting City resources by allowing nearly 12 brand new electric vehicles with a combined value of over $384,000 to sit unused for over two years at a GSD yard instead of placing them into service. The investigation concluded that DOT did not have the proper electric charging infrastructure in place to deploy the vehicles when they were purchased which resulted in the vehicles sitting unused. The vehicles were ultimately placed into service and we recommended that the department perform a thorough evaluation as to whether there is appropriate infrastructure in place prior to purchasing similar assets that require new infrastructure for their operation.\nTheft of City Resources\nA hotline tip reported that an employee was using City electricity to charge their electric vehicle for free by using a standard wall outlet at a City employee parking garage. This was not only a violation of City policy but was also a safety issue as the wall outlets are not meant to be used for electric vehicle charging. General Services Parking Division issued an administrative warning and reminded the employee of the City’s electric vehicle charger guidelines.\nFWA UNIT PROCESS\nCase Intake\n\n The FWA Unit can receive cases from any City department, Office, or employee, as well as any member of the public. Cases are primarily received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through a web intake form that can be accessed at https://lacontroller.org/report-fraud-waste-and-abuse or via the hotline phone number (866) 428-1514.\n\nAny person submitting a complaint or allegation to the FWA Unit may do so anonymously. The City’s Ethics Ordinance protects whistleblowers who report or attempt to report possible violations of law from retaliation. Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to whistleblower retaliation may file a confidential complaint with the City Ethics Commission, which shall investigate and take appropriate action. Information regarding the FWA Unit’s cases may not be disclosed, except as necessary to conduct investigations, facilitate referrals for appropriate action, or if required by law.\n\nDuring 2021, the majority of cases received by the FWA Unit were reported anonymously.  Ninety-four percent of the cases were received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline, either through the web intake form or the toll-free phone number. A small number of cases were received via email, U.S. mail, or in-person.\n\n                        \n\nExcept when prohibited by law, Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 20.60.4 requires City departments and appointed Offices to report to the Controller’s Office FWA Unit any matter involving potential FWA within ten days of discovery of information that reasonably indicates that the matter involves FWA of City resources.\n\nCase Evaluation\n\nThe FWA Unit evaluates every case received. This includes a thorough review of all information submitted by the reporting party and can include FWA staff reviewing City data or other public databases and other information to thoughtfully evaluate the issues. Based on this evaluation, the FWA Unit will then determine whether the allegations: 1) are outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and/or have no FWA impact; 2) are non-FWA investigative matters that should be referred to another City Department or jurisdiction for appropriate action; or 3) are FWA investigative matters that require an investigation or further review to be conducted by the FWA Unit or a City department. The FWA Unit may also conduct joint investigations with other entities as appropriate.\n\nCases evaluated as outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction include those that are unrelated to City operations, involve personnel-related matters, and cases for which there are no FWA issues alleged. Nevertheless, these cases may be referred to the appropriate outside agency or City Department for their consideration. For example, in 2020 several cases cited COVID-19 safety concerns and phone scammers posing as utility employees; these were referred to the applicable City Department, LADWP, or law enforcement, as appropriate. If the complaint is based solely on the reporter’s opinion, or the reported risk has been addressed through a City policy change, the case will be closed with no further action. If the matter is the subject of pending or current litigation, the case will be referred to the Office of the City Attorney.\n\nCases evaluated as requiring a referral to another City department or other jurisdiction for appropriate action are non-FWA investigative matters. These are issues best suited for the department to act on, but do not warrant an investigation focused on the impact to City resources. Examples include minor employee misconduct and customer service issues.\n\nCases evaluated as FWA investigative matters are those that have sufficient information, as garnered through the FWA Unit’s research into the allegation or documentation provided by the reporting party, which provide a reasonable basis that a FWA matter occurred or is still occurring. The case may be assigned to a City department for investigation or be investigated by FWA Unit staff, especially when the case requires forensic review of financial records, is more complex, or may be widespread due to lax internal controls.\n\n2021 CASE METRICS\nCase Status\n\nThe following chart summarizes caseload count for the calendar year.\n\nDuring 2021, the FWA Unit closed a total of 508 cases. The case closure by category is summarized in the following chart.\n\nCase Analysis by Issue Type\n\nViolations or abuse of City policy was the leading type of issue reported among the cases closed during the year; accounting for 16 of the 38 cases that required an investigation.\n\nCase Analysis by Location\n\nA summary of case metrics by department are as follows:"

Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMore than five years have passed since Angelenos overwhelmingly approved Proposition HHH. The ballot measure authorized the City to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds to develop or acquire supportive housing. Supportive housing combines subsidized housing with services (e.g., health services, mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training) to help improve the lives of chronically homeless people. Proposition HHH funds can also be used to develop affordable (i.e., income-restricted) housing for people at-risk of homelessness or facilities such as shelters, restrooms, showers, storage, health clinics, and navigation centers. The ballot measure requires at least 80% of HHH funds to be used for supportive housing and facilities, and up to 20% can be used to develop affordable housing.\n\nSince Proposition HHH was approved, the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles has grown in magnitude and severity. The most recent point-in-time count—conducted before the pandemic—showed tens of thousands of unsheltered residents and a growing number of daily tragedies due to overdoses and violence. Recent policy decisions and shifts in public opinion suggest widespread dissatisfaction with the current situation. While Proposition HHH was not designed to end homelessness in Los Angeles, it remains a centerpiece of the City’s strategy.\n\nProposition HHH requires the Controller’s Office to perform annual financial audits for each year in which bonds are outstanding or bond proceeds remain unspent. The audit for fiscal year 2020 (see Appendix) did not identify any significant irregularities or improprieties related to Proposition HHH.\n\nWe also reviewed the performance of the program. Our 2019 and 2020 reviews of Proposition HHH found that project costs were high and estimated timelines were not aligned with the urgency of the homeless emergency in Los Angeles. This review was intended to provide a status update on Proposition HHH and assess the extent to which the City implemented our previous recommendations. Unless stated otherwise, the data and information contained in this report provides a snapshot of the program as of December 2021.\n\nWe found mixed results during this review of Proposition HHH.\n\nThe number of completed housing projects and projects in construction increased since our last review. But per unit costs continue to climb to excessive levels—over $800,000 in one instance—and the total number of completed units (1,142) is wholly inadequate in the context of the ongoing homelessness emergency.\nThe HHH Housing Challenge continues to show promise in terms of per unit costs, but most of the projects are significantly behind development timelines that were established when the program was launched in 2019.\nThe City is in the process of implementing two recommendations from our previous reports. Specifically, the City has taken steps to improve case processing timelines in several departments and is planning to use Proposition HHH funds to acquire extended-stay hotels and newly-built apartment buildings without tenants.\n\nGiven the scale of the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles, the need to build supportive, affordable, and interim housing will remain long after funds from Proposition HHH are fully depleted. It is critical that the City use lessons learned from the last several years to guide its future efforts.\n\nMost bond proceeds remain unspent, but nearly $750 million in loans have been closed\n\nThe City has designated more than $1.1 billion in Proposition HHH funds. Approximately 95% of the designated funds have been set aside for development of supportive and affordable housing. The conditional funding commitments are eligible for loan closing once developers successfully complete the financing process and obtain the necessary entitlements to build. The City has closed approximately $750 million in HHH-funded loans to date.\n\nProposition HHH bond proceeds are typically not disbursed to developers until loans close and construction begins. To ensure adequate funds are on hand for this process, the City periodically issues Proposition HHH general obligation bonds. The table below provides a snapshot of the bond issuances since the ballot measure was approved and Proposition HHH funds that have been disbursed.\n\nAs shown in the table, the City has issued bonds valued at almost half of the total amount authorized by voters. A significant portion of bond proceeds remain unspent—relative to the total bonds issued and to the maximum authorized amount—but this process will likely accelerate in the coming months due to the number of projects that have recently moved into the construction phase.\n\nLess than 1,200 housing units have been completed, but there are almost 4,400 units in construction\n\nThe City set a goal of developing 10,000 housing units within a ten-year timeframe. According to the City, its plans to reach this goal consisted of housing units developed using HHH funds and supportive units developed using non-HHH funding sources. There are 8,091 total housing units (6,579 supportive) spread across 125 projects that have been designated funding through Proposition HHH. The non-HHH pipeline includes 2,369 supportive units.\n\nThe Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) is responsible for facilitating the development of most housing units funded through Proposition HHH. More than five years after voters approved Proposition HHH, only 1,142 total units have been completed. However, the overall share of units in pre-development dropped considerably since our last report—from 71% to 26%. This represents important progress. The following graphs provide an overview of all housing units being developed through the LAHD/HHH pipeline.\n\nIn addition to the LAHD/HHH pipeline, there are 864 units being developed through the HHH Housing Challenge, which was launched in 2019. The City set aside $120 million in funds with the intention of finding ways to lower costs and shorten timelines using strategies outside of the LAHD/HHH process. Nearly all of these units (84%) remain in pre-development.\n\nTotal development costs for Proposition HHH housing projects continued to grow\n\nLos Angeles is an expensive place to build multifamily housing—that challenge is embedded into the cost of developing supportive housing through Proposition HHH. It is further complicated by a combination of cost factors including prevailing wage requirements, financing complexity, land use issues, project labor agreements, and building characteristics (e.g., enhanced accessibility standards). In addition, the pandemic has created a variety of labor and supply chain issues, further pushing costs upward.\n\nFunds from Proposition HHH make up only a portion of total development costs. Across all projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline, the HHH subsidy per unit is approximately $134,000, or 23% of the total development cost of a project. The remaining funds come from a combination of private and other government (i.e., taxpayer) sources. The large amount of public subsidies—which are finite—underscores the importance of controlling project costs beyond the City’s Proposition HHH contribution. The following snapshot shows estimated per unit development costs through the LAHD/HHH pipeline.\n\nBased on our analysis, construction costs typically make up approximately 63% of total development costs for projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline. Developers typically finalize construction contracts with general contractors as their projects move toward loan closing (i.e., the latter stages of the pre-development phase). As a result, overall project costs reflect construction market conditions at the time contracts were signed.\n\nProposition HHH loans for all of the completed projects were closed in 2018 and 2019 (i.e., pre-pandemic). The significant increase in costs for projects in construction can be partly attributed to pandemic-driven spikes in the cost of lumber and other building materials. Approximately 14% of units in construction exceed $700,000 per unit.\nBudgets for projects currently in pre-development will be adjusted—potentially upward—once developers finalize construction contracts. One project in this group is currently estimated to cost $837,000 per unit. The HHH-funded project is part of a larger mixed-use development led by the Los Angeles County Development Authority. The City cited County Workforce Agreements, infrastructure upgrades, and parking costs as some of the contributing factors to the high per unit cost.\n\nThe per unit cost of the three HHH Housing Challenge projects in construction is approximately $450,000 and the estimated per unit cost for 12 projects in pre-development is $434,000. Overall, projects in the HHH Housing Innovation Challenge are on track to receive less HHH funds per unit ($111,000) compared to projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline.\n\nThere are other ways to contextualize costs associated with housing projects being developed through Proposition HHH. Approximately 87% of the units being built through the LAHD/HHH pipeline are compact studios or one-bedroom apartments. The remaining units consist of multiple bedrooms and are intended to house families experiencing homelessness. The City estimates that between 9,000 and 14,000 people will be housed when all projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline are completed. Using this methodology, the estimated cost per tenant or bedroom would be lower than the per unit costs described above.\n\nWhile project costs and timelines are distinct lenses through which to evaluate projects, they are intrinsically linked. Developers of projects with higher costs typically have a larger funding/financing gap to fill, which adds time and complexity to the process. Longer project timelines typically contribute to higher carrying costs and greater uncertainty for supportive housing developers and investors.  \n\nDevelopment timelines for Proposition HHH-funded housing projects continued to grow—more than half of total housing units will not be completed until January 2023 or later\n\nThe overall project lifecycle for projects developed through the LAHD/HHH pipeline is divided into four key phases: planning; pre-development; construction; and lease up. For purposes of this review, we focused on pre-development and construction phases.\n\nA major factor in pre-pandemic timelines for projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline has been the design of the program itself. Proposition HHH funds are typically the first funding source for projects. Developers are provided up to two years in pre-development to secure adequate funding/financing from several different entities to make their project viable. The pre-development process also consists of obtaining the necessary permits and approvals from City departments to begin construction.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic disrupted several components of the pre-development and construction process. Government agencies faced staffing shortages, extended funding timelines/deadlines, and implemented social distancing requirements at worksites. The table below provides a snapshot of project timelines from the LAHD/HHH pipeline. It measures the length of time from funding commitment to occupancy stage for the 15 projects completed since our last report and remaining projects which are in progress.\n\nThe City established an aggressive two-year project completion timeline for developers that received funding approvals through the HHH Housing Challenge. The original goal was for these projects to complete construction by the end of 2022, but the pandemic and other factors affected the trajectory of the program. Based on current estimates, the length of time to complete HHH Housing Challenge projects may not be significantly different than projects developed through the LAHD/HHH pipeline.\n\nThe graph below provides a snapshot of actual and estimated completion dates for all housing units funded through Proposition HHH since the ballot measure was approved—more than half of the total units are not scheduled to be completed until January 2023 or later.\n\nEven after Proposition HHH-funded housing projects are completed, much work remains. Many of the chronically homeless Angelenos residing in these apartments will need assistance in the form of wraparound services, which is the responsibility of Los Angeles County. It is also important that adequate resources and support are available to help people who wish to transition out of supportive housing because they no longer need or desire services.\n\nRecommendation Follow Up\n\nOur previous reviews of Proposition HHH concluded that project costs were high and estimated development timelines did not reflect the needs of unhoused residents living in dangerous conditions. Specific recommendations from our previous reviews are listed below, along with updates on the City’s progress toward implementation.\n\nChange course on expensive or stalled projects before finalizing HHH loans\tNot Implemented\n\nSeveral projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline have been beset by significant cost increases and delays after receiving conditional funding commitments from the City. We recommended that the City evaluate its ability to reallocate Proposition HHH funding from outlier projects before loans close. At the time of this review, there were 27 projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline without loans in place.\n\nThe City does not intend to implement this recommendation due to concerns that early cancellation of a funding commitment would compromise business relationships with supportive/affordable housing developers who have secured sites and worked in good faith to move projects forward. In addition, City officials cautioned that withdrawing a funding commitment could create legal issues for the City.\n\nSpeed up City review processes for HHH-funded projects.\tIn progress\n\nOur previous reviews of Proposition HHH highlighted the City’s longstanding challenges with timely and efficient approvals for multifamily housing. We recommended that the City make improvements to its permitting processes, increase staffing, expand the scope of its existing streamlining policy, and implement public reporting requirements for relevant departments.\n\nWhile the onset of the pandemic has created staffing challenges and the City needs to improve its overall digital services strategy, the issuance of Executive Directive #30 (ED30) in April 2021 established case processing goals and increased the number of departments that must participate in streamlining efforts. But the City has not yet developed a public-facing dashboard to increase transparency and accountability.\n\nBuild more interim housing and facilities using funds from Proposition HHH\tNot Implemented\n\nOne of our ongoing concerns about Proposition HHH has been the imbalance in how the funds have been distributed across project types. Despite a mounting death toll of unsheltered residents, the City has focused almost exclusively on building supportive housing—typically from the ground up—which is expensive and takes several years to complete. The City began building bridge shelters in 2018, but the overall number of beds fell significantly short of the tens of thousands of unsheltered Angelenos. Stopgap measures like interim housing and facilities will not end homelessness, but they will improve living conditions for unsheltered residents who are waiting for supportive housing that will not be built for several years.\n\nTo date, the City has set aside approximately $58 million in Proposition HHH funds for interim housing/facilities—a mere 5% of the $1.1 billion that has been designated. We recommended that the City reallocate Proposition HHH funds or use remaining funds to develop interim housing or facilities. This amount has remained unchanged, but the City has designated significant amounts of emergency federal funding to develop 6,700 homeless interventions (e.g., tiny home villages, hotel/motel rooms, safe parking) as part of an agreement with the County. The addition of these sites is important progress for both unsheltered residents and neighborhoods with large encampments.\n\nAcquire and convert commercial properties or apartment buildings without tenants\tIn progress\n\nNew construction of multifamily housing in Los Angeles is both expensive and time consuming. Given the magnitude and severity of the homelessness crisis, we recommended that the City prioritize strategies such as acquiring and converting buildings without tenants—like hotels and motels—because of the potential time and cost savings. While older buildings typically require renovations to make them compliant with accessibility and fire safety requirements, they are less likely to approach $600,000 per unit.\n\nThe State launched a program (“Project Homekey”) using this approach as part of its emergency pandemic response in 2020. Local government entities were required to provide matching funds and the properties needed to be brought into service shortly after acquisition. The City acquired 15 properties using non-HHH funds and most of the sites will function as interim housing for three to five years until they are converted to supportive housing. Altogether, these acquisitions included 891 units at a cost of approximately $223,000 per unit. The City cautions that the costs to convert several of the properties may be significant given the overall site conditions and enhanced accessibility requirements.\n\nOver the last several months, the City began planning for a second wave of Project Homekey acquisitions as a result of additional funds made available by the State. Unlike the initial phase of Project Homekey, the City is planning to use $83 million in remaining Proposition HHH funds to fulfill a portion of the program’s matching requirements. At the time of this report, the City is seeking to acquire nine properties (a mix of extended-stay hotels and newly-built but never occupied apartment buildings) at a total cost of approximately $427 million. If these acquisitions are successful, they will provide 868 units of supportive housing at an estimated cost of $492,000 per unit. In addition, they will likely be placed into service within the span of months—in sharp contrast to most housing projects funded through Proposition HHH.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe passage of Proposition HHH remains a critical moment in the City’s recent history. It facilitated the development of thousands of units of housing that will help unhoused residents and people at risk of homelessness. Our previous reviews of Proposition HHH highlighted gaps in the City’s overall strategy and issues—some of which are outside the City’s direct control—that contribute to expensive projects and lengthy development timelines. During this review, we found that less than 1,200 units have been produced in five years and estimated costs for several projects exceed $700,000 per unit.\n\nEven after all HHH-funded housing projects are completed, it is likely that significantly more Angelenos will be experiencing homelessness compared to when the ballot measure was approved. Each day spent without housing or shelter puts those individuals at risk for tragic outcomes. While future plans have not been finalized, building tens of thousands of additional units using the same model will likely cost billions of dollars and will take far too long to match the urgency of the ongoing homeless emergency. Going forward, we continue to urge the City to pursue more balanced approaches and find ways to scale up faster and cheaper projects.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn November 2016, more than 77% of voters in the City of Los Angeles (City) approved Proposition HHH. The ballot measure authorized the City to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds to develop or acquire supportive housing. Proposition HHH funds can also be used to develop affordable (i.e., income-restricted) housing for people at-risk of homelessness or facilities such as shelters, restrooms, showers, storage, health clinics, and navigation centers. The ballot measure requires at least 80% of HHH funds to be used for supportive housing and facilities, and up to 20% can be used to develop affordable housing.\n\nProposition HHH requires the Controller’s Office to perform annual audits for each year in which bonds are outstanding or bond proceeds remain unspent. The financial audit for fiscal year 2020 (see Appendix) did not identify any significant irregularities or improprieties related to Proposition HHH.\n\nConsistent with the authority established in the City Charter, we also reviewed the performance of the program in 2019 and 2020. We found that the total cost of developing housing projects using HHH funds was high (approximately $550,000 per unit in 2020) and estimated timelines (three to six years from concept to occupancy) were not aligned with the growing magnitude and severity of the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles. Accordingly, we recommended that the City pursue the following strategies to help lower costs, shorten timelines, and maximize the overall impact of funds from Proposition HHH.\n\nChange course on expensive, slow projects – Despite years of data showing rising construction costs and project delays, the City’s overall strategy has remained mostly unchanged. We recommended that the City evaluate its ability to reallocate funding from outlier projects before loans close and find ways to use any remaining Proposition HHH funds to deliver faster and less expensive projects.\nSpeed up City approval processes – The City has longstanding challenges with permitting and interdepartmental coordination in the context of housing development. We recommended that the City boost staffing, expand its existing streamlining efforts, and increase transparency and accountability around these issues.\nBuild more interim housing and support facilities – Stopgap measures will not end homelessness in Los Angeles. But using available Proposition HHH funds to increase the supply of interim housing and facilities will help unhoused residents meet their basic health, hygiene, sanitation, and storage needs.\nAcquire and convert commercial properties or apartment buildings without tenants – Nearly all Proposition HHH housing projects are new construction, which means that overall costs are directly tied to the rising cost of labor and materials. Different approaches—which require less construction—could prove cheaper and faster to complete if adequate funding is available to purchase and repurpose hotels/motels, unused commercial/office space, and newly-built residential buildings that have not been leased up.\n\nMore than five years have passed since Angelenos overwhelmingly approved Proposition HHH. This milestone provides an opportunity to measure the City’s progress to date, follow up on recommendations, and identify lessons learned that should inform future programmatic and policy decisions about homelessness. Unless stated otherwise, the data and information contained in this report provides a snapshot of the program as of December 2021.\n\nHOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES\n\nThere is an extensive body of research that explores the underlying causes of homelessness. Academics, subject matter experts, and people with lived experience have identified factors such as structural racism, stagnant wages, lack of affordable housing, and an overall weakening of the social safety net. And while several of the causes identified by researchers are decades in the making and outside of the City’s direct control, the overall effects of those societal challenges and policy decisions can be seen throughout Los Angeles.\n\nHousing and facilities developed using funds from Proposition HHH are part of a larger strategic framework designed to tackle homelessness. The City’s Enhanced Comprehensive Homeless Strategy provides the roadmap and direction to departments to implement programs and projects. The County of Los Angeles (County) has a similar strategy roadmap and uses funds from Measure H (passed by voters in March 2017) to provide an ongoing revenue stream to fund services, rental subsidies, and housing. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) has a central role in conducting outreach and administering programs that provide shelter, housing, and services to people experiencing homelessness.\n\nDespite significant funding and attention over the last several years, the homelessness crisis continued to grow in Los Angeles—even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMore people are falling into homelessness – The most recent point-in-time count (conducted in January 2020) estimated that there were more than 41,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles, a 45% increase since 2016. Similarly, the same point-in-time count estimated that there were nearly 29,000 unsheltered individuals—which represented a 35% increase since 2016. Although the 2021 point-in-time count was suspended due to public health concerns about COVID-19, data from the upcoming point-in-time count (scheduled for February 2022) will provide valuable insight into how the homeless population in Los Angeles has changed—and whether the City’s approach should change.\nUnhoused residents continue to suffer tragic outcomes – An upcoming report from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH) will provide greater insight into how many people experiencing homelessness have died since 2019 and the underlying causes of those tragedies.DPH’s last report included a preliminary analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on the unhoused population during the seven-month period (January to July 2020) which represented the onset of the pandemic. DPH estimated that 929 unhoused residents died during this period—approximately five people each day—and noted that the total number of deaths represented a 26% increase compared to the same seven-month period in 2019. But DPH found that COVID-19 was the fifth leading cause of death for unhoused residents—drug/alcohol overdoses ranked first. The research also showed a spike in deaths across racial/ethnic groups resulting from fentanyl-related overdoses.\n\nThe lack of progress—real, perceived, or some combination thereof—around the issue of homelessness is fueling policy changes and reshaping public opinion. For example, the City made significant changes to its camping laws throughout 2021 and a large number of geographic zones are now off limits to unhoused residents. In addition, the Los Angeles Business Council, in coordination with the Los Angeles Times, recently conducted a poll of 906 voters in LA County which highlighted growing dissatisfaction with the current situation.\n\nWhen asked about the issue of homelessness in LA County, 79% of respondents stated that the situation has gotten worse in the last several years. In addition, 89% of respondents stated that homelessness has either gotten worse or stayed the same in their own neighborhood.\nBy nearly a 2-to-1 margin, respondents preferred using existing funding to build short-term shelter sites which can be built quickly/cheaply for most of the homeless population (57%) rather than building long-term housing which costs more/takes longer and may serve a smaller segment of the homeless population (30%). A similar question from the 2019 version of the survey showed strong support for long-term policies (59%) over short-term policies (23%).\n\nThese shifts in public opinion are noteworthy given the possibility that Angelenos will be voting on a ballot measure in November 2022 that is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue for a variety of initiatives to tackle homelessness–including development of supportive housing. Given that possibility, it is critical that the City use insights from its experience with Proposition HHH as a guide for its future efforts.\n\nPROPOSITION HHH STATUS\n\nThe City set a goal of developing 10,000 housing units within a ten-year timeframe. According to the City, its plans to reach this goal consist of housing units developed using HHH funds and supportive units developed using non-HHH funding sources. Based on the current trajectory of the program, there are 8,091 total housing units across 125 projects that have received or will likely receive funds from Proposition HHH. The total units include 6,578 units of supportive housing and 1,513 units of non-supportive housing (i.e., income-restricted affordable housing and building manager units). The non-HHH pipeline includes 2,369 supportive units.\n\nThe distribution of Proposition HHH funds across program categories remain mostly unchanged since our last report. The City did not initiate a formal call for projects and allocate any remaining funds, although potential uses for remaining and reprogrammed funds have been discussed with the Council and Proposition HHH Citizens Oversight Committee.\n\nThe City set aside nearly all Proposition HHH funds for development of supportive and affordable housing\n\nData reported by the City shows that approximately $1.1 billion—nearly the entire amount authorized by the ballot measure—has been designated as of December 2021. Nearly all (95%) of the designated funds have been set aside for development of supportive and affordable housing.\n\nAlthough Proposition HHH was presented to voters primarily as a strategy to increase production of supportive housing, it also authorized the City to use HHH funds to develop interim shelter and facilities. But the ballot measure did not specify the funding distribution across these categories and key funding and programmatic decisions were left to the Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD), the Office of the City Administrative Officer (CAO), and City Policymakers.\n\nThe City’s decision to primarily focus on permanent housing was guided by the Housing First approach to homelessness, which has been supported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), State of California, and LAHSA. Housing First approaches seek to quickly house people experiencing homelessness without preconditions such as sobriety or treatment/service participation requirements.\n\nSupportive housing is typically intended to provide chronically homeless residents with access to services such as mental health and health services, drug and alcohol treatment, education, and job training so that they can achieve housing stability and improve their quality of life. In the context of Proposition HHH, the City funds development of supportive housing and the County funds or directly provides onsite services through its various departments.\n\nEven after all of the housing units built using Proposition HHH funds are filled with tenants, more work is needed to promote equitable and successful outcomes. The California Policy Lab recently found that 22% of enrollees in supportive housing in Los Angeles County fell back into homelessness or interim housing between January 2010 and June 2019. Of particular concern is that Black residents of supportive housing appear to be experiencing this outcome at a greater rate than other racial/ethnic groups in the study. The study also raised important questions about the consistency of services being provided, lack of opportunities for personal growth and independence, and lack of institutional support for residents who aim to move beyond supportive housing.\n\nLAHD/HHH DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE\n\nDevelopment of most Proposition HHH-funded housing projects is led by LAHD. Rather than providing developers with funds to cover the full cost of a project, the City designed the program to provide partial funding in the form of loans. Proposition HHH funds are then leveraged to secure other sources of funding, often federal tax credits that developers must compete for through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. This approach is widely used to develop government-funded housing with income restrictions.\n\nThe leveraging process comes with tradeoffs. On one hand, Proposition HHH funds can be stretched across a greater number of projects/units. Indeed, Proposition HHH funds are being leveraged at a 4-to-1 rate. On the other hand, the process of securing multiple sources of funding to make a project viable typically adds time and costs to each project.\n\nAlthough a formal call for projects has not been issued since February 2019, LAHD has typically solicited proposals from private housing developers seeking to build supportive housing with Proposition HHH funds. Applications submitted by developers are screened by LAHD to determine whether they meet specific baseline criteria, including:\n\nverification that the developer secured a property on which a Proposition HHH project could be built;\na determination that the project is financially feasible and demonstrates long-term viability as an affordable housing project; and\nconfirmation that the developer and service provider successfully managed similar supportive housing projects in the past.\n\nAt the conclusion of this process, LAHD staff develop funding recommendations that are submitted to multiple oversight committees, the City Council, and Mayor. Proposition HHH funding commitments for housing are conditional for up to two years and are typically made early in the development process. Developers spend this initial phase assembling funding to make their projects viable and obtaining necessary permits/approvals from City departments required for building multifamily housing (i.e., pre-development).\n\nApproximately $970 million has been designated through the LAHD/HHH pipeline. The funds are spread across 110 housing projects and December 2021 estimates show that they will provide 7,227 total housing units—5,730 of which will be supportive units. The graphs below provide a snapshot of LAHD’s portfolio of Proposition HHH projects at the time we completed each performance review of the program.\n\nThere are two key points that emerge from the graphs.\n\nOnly 1,142 total units—831 of which are supportive—are ready for occupancy more than five years after voters approved Proposition HHH.\nSince our last report, LAHD has made progress in moving projects in the pipeline from the pre-development phase into construction.\n\nIn addition, the total number of projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline has remained stable. At the time of our last report, uncertainties related to the pandemic increased the risk that multiple projects would be cancelled. The lone project that was discontinued returned its Proposition HHH loan (approximately $3.1 million), but is moving forward using other funding sources.\n\nHHH HOUSING CHALLENGE\n\nIn response to concerns about project costs and timelines, the City set aside $120 million in Proposition HHH funds and initiated the HHH Housing Challenge in January 2019. The primary goal was to identify innovative construction and financing models to produce approximately 1,000 new supportive housing units within two years after receiving funding approval.\n\nThe City issued a request for proposals in May 2019 and allowed respondents to submit project applications before having a legal possession of a site on which to build housing (i.e., site control). In order to be considered for funding, applicants needed to demonstrate that their proposed approach was not eligible or feasible under current existing Proposition HHH program regulations. Development strategies submitted by applicants were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team of subject matter experts for a variety of factors, including financial feasibility, creativity, achievability, and scalability.\n\nThe selection committee recommended six developers for funding approval. Combined, their proposed projects aimed to provide 975 supportive housing units. Each developer was required to execute a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the City within two months of being selected through the RFP process. The MOUs outlined each developer’s general plan and established milestones for each phase in the development process.\n\nMultiple projects in the HHH Housing Challenge were recently cancelled due to issues with site control and other projects are returning a portion of their funding commitment because they secured other sources of funding. The City is considering re-programming approximately $23 million previously designed for the HHH Housing Challenge.\n\nCAO/HHH FACILITIES PROGRAM\n\nThe Office of the City Administrative Officer (CAO) oversees the development of facilities and interim housing using Proposition HHH funds. The City funded 24 of these projects using approximately $58 million. The relatively limited scope of this effort was driven by the City’s decision to prioritize development of supportive housing. In 2018, the Council voted to suspend a planned request for proposals (RFP) and the CAO has not issued another solicitation for HHH-funded interim housing or facilities.\n\nEligible projects included rehabilitation or expansion of existing sites and acquisition or construction of new sites. In addition, projects that enhanced existing facilities to improve service delivery—such as retrofits to make buildings compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)—were also eligible. The overall list of completed and ongoing projects is shown below, most of which are renovations of existing facilities.\n\nFacility Type\tHHH Award\tTotal Cost\tCompleted\tIn process\nCenter\t$27,484,949\t$31,750,275\t5\t2\nShelter\t$12,013,398\t$12,615,578\t2\t3\nClinic\t$7,200,000\t$26,738,840\t2\t0\nTransitional Housing\t$7,114,439\t$7,214,439\t3\t1\nDV Shelter\t$3,891,338\t$6,100,108\t3\t3\nTotals\t$57,704,124\t$84,419,240\t15\t9\n\n \n\nAs described later in this report, the City has significantly increased its production of interim housing through an agreement with the County, which was partly driven by a federal lawsuit. Proposition HHH funds were not used for those projects.\n\nMost funds remained unspent, but the City has formally closed approximately $750 million in Proposition HHH housing loans\n\nThe conditional funding commitments for Proposition HHH housing projects described above are a part of a larger process. Actual disbursement of bond proceeds from Proposition HHH does not occur until loans are executed and housing projects are ready to begin construction. The City has closed approximately $750 million in HHH-funded loans to date. LAHD is tasked with reviewing invoices submitted by developers and approving payments based on actual work performed.\n\nThe CAO oversees the development of facilities and interim housing using Proposition HHH funds, which are made available as loans repayable through a service repayment agreement with a term corresponding to the useful life of the funded facility. Developers of facilities must periodically submit requests for reimbursement payments that are subject to review and approval by CAO staff.\n\nTo date, the City has issued three Proposition HHH bonds with a combined value of almost $575 million and spent approximately $347 million of total bond proceeds on hand. The amount of funds spent—which is tied to construction progress—represents a relatively small share of the City’s $1.2 billion bonding authority approved by voters in November 2016. But the large number of projects that recently began construction will accelerate the rate at which Proposition HHH funds are spent.\n\nPROPOSITION HHH PROJECT COSTS\n\nDevelopment costs are typically divided into three basic categories:\n\nacquisition of land where the project will be built;\nlabor and materials for construction (“hard costs”); and\nall costs other than land or construction to complete the project, including fees, financing, professional services (“soft costs”).\n\nEven before the pandemic, a study by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation found that construction costs for multifamily buildings across the State were rising due to factors such as gaps in the construction workforce and higher materials costs. The unprecedented disruption brought on by the pandemic and other factors accelerated these trends. Existing labor shortages in the construction industry became more pronounced and the cost of some construction materials—such as lumber—skyrocketed. While these costs have somewhat stabilized from their record highs, they remain markedly higher than their pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThere are also specific factors associated with building supportive housing—both generally and in Los Angeles—that contribute to high project costs. Our previous reviews of Proposition HHH highlighted several key factors such as the overall high cost of construction in Los Angeles, prevailing wage requirements, funding complexity, regulatory issues, land use challenges, and supportive housing characteristics (e.g., enhanced accessibility standards). In addition, research by the RAND Corporation recently highlighted that project labor agreements—which are required for all HHH projects at least 65 units—can increase construction costs by approximately 15%.\n\nSome stakeholders have downplayed concerns about high total development costs because Proposition HHH funds are not being used to fully fund housing projects. Across all projects in the LAHD/HHH Development Pipeline, Proposition HHH funds comprise approximately 23% of total development costs. According to LAHD, costs not covered by HHH are typically funded by:\n\na loan from a bank or bond lender;\nequity investors seeking federal tax credits (typically LIHTC); and\nother governmental programs.\n\nWhile federal tax credits and funding from State/County programs are not funded by the City, they are still taxpayer dollars and must be carefully spent.\n\nThe overall cost of Proposition HHH-funded housing projects continued to grow\n\nBecause construction contracts are finalized as the project approaches loan closing, original cost estimates—which are typically developed up to two years in advance—are subject to revision as the projects move from the pre-development phase into construction. This key point—HHH project development costs reflect market conditions at the time construction contracts are signed—is essential to understanding the program. Proposition HHH loan amounts to developers cannot be increased to account for construction budget cost overruns without the approval of the Council.\n\nCOST OF PROPOSITION HHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS READY FOR OCCUPANCY\n\nThere are 18 LAHD/HHH pipeline projects that have been completed and are ready for occupancy. In total, the projects include 1,142 housing units, 831 of which are supportive. The City awarded approximately $154 million in Proposition HHH loans for these projects—an average of approximately $135,000 per unit.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of total development costs for projects ready for occupancy. It should be noted that this group of projects closed their loans between December 2017 and November 2019—before the tumult of the pandemic began affecting project costs and timelines.\n\nIn addition, LAHD notes that projects are still under construction when they reach the “Ready for Occupancy” stage. Construction doesn’t end—and the final costs are not officially tabulated—until all punch list items are completed, and when the Final Certificate of Occupancy is obtained. As a result, the costs listed above may be further revised until projects are officially complete. Proposition HHH program regulations require a third-party cost certification audit to be completed within 60 days of the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.\n\nTo determine how development costs are distributed across projects, we analyzed data from LAHD and found they were consistent with a 2020 study by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.\n\nThe relatively small share of costs attributed to land acquisition may be attributed to the fact that four of the projects were built on City-owned land.\n\nCOST OF PROPOSITION HHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS IN CONSTRUCTION\n\nThere are 65 projects in construction through the LAHD/HHH pipeline that will provide 4,205 housing units, 3,478 of which will be supportive. The City awarded approximately $578 million in Proposition HHH loans for these projects—an average of approximately $137,000 per unit.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of projects in construction. Nearly all of these projects closed their loans in 2020 or 2021, suggesting that the disruption of the pandemic likely affected project budgets and timelines.\n\nAs shown in the table, the per unit cost of these projects is on the verge of exceeding $600,000 per unit. In addition, approximately 14% of the units in construction are estimated to cost more than $700,000 per unit. LAHD provided additional information about the individual projects that have crossed the $700,000 per unit threshold. Beyond across-the-board increases in construction costs that apply to all projects, LAHD provided site-specific issues such as parking requirements, units with multiple bedrooms, commercial space, and small/unique lot configurations.\n\nAs expected, construction costs saw an overall increase and as a ratio of total project costs.\n\nAccording to the data, 16 of these projects are being built on City-owned land.\n\nCOST OF PROPOSITION HHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS IN PRE-DEVELOPMENT\n\nThere are 27 projects in pre-development in the LAHD/HHH Development Pipeline that are expected to provide 1,880 housing units, 1,421 of which are projected to be supportive. The City awarded approximately $240 million in Proposition HHH loans for these projects—an average of approximately $128,000 per unit.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of projects in pre-development. These projects have not finalized their loans or signed construction contracts, so their overall project costs will likely trend upward given the sustained disruption in labor and materials markets.\n\nAs shown in the table, this group includes a project with an estimated cost over $800,000. The project is a 62-unit senior supportive housing project component of a larger 4.2-acre mixed-use development being led by the County. The City’s HHH contribution is $200,000 per unit of senior housing. The development also includes affordable housing, retail spaces including a grocery store, and Metro training facility. According to LAHD, there are several cost drivers affecting the project including: extensive site preparation costs; development of a parking structure for the senior housing; a County Community Workforce Agreement.\n\nThe estimated costs and cost distribution of projects in pre-development are outlined below.\n\nProjects in pre-development show higher estimated land costs compared to projects in construction or ready for occupancy. The increase is driven by six projects which report land acquisition costs above $5 million each.\n\nThere are other ways to contextualize costs associated with housing projects being developed through Proposition HHH. Approximately 87% of the residential (i.e, non-building manager) units being built through the LAHD/HHH pipeline are compact studios or one-bedroom apartments. The remaining units consist of multiple bedrooms and are intended to house families experiencing homelessness. The City estimates that between 9,000 and 14,000 people will be housed when all projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline are completed. Using this methodology, the estimated per tenant or bed cost would be lower than the per unit costs described above.\n\nCOST OF HHH HOUSING CHALLENGE PROJECTS\n\nThere are currently three projects from the HHH Housing Challenge in construction with an average HHH contribution of approximately $124,000 per unit. A single developer is responsible for all three projects, which include modular construction on smaller parcels. When completed, the projects will provide 142 total housing units, of which 139 will be supportive. The current estimated cost per unit for these projects is approximately $449,889. While the sample size is insufficient to draw larger conclusions, these projects have lower cost estimates than typical projects from the LAHD/HHH pipeline that are currently in construction.\n\nThere are 15 additional HHH Housing Challenge projects currently in pre-development with an average HHH contribution of approximately $109,000 per unit. When completed, these projects will provide 722 total housing units, of which 709 will be supportive. The current estimated cost per unit for these projects is $434,151.\n\nWhile the estimated cost of the HHH Housing Challenge projects is promising, questions remain about whether the approach can be successfully scaled and replicated. In addition, the current cost projections are markedly higher than the per unit estimates ($352,000) provided during the 2019 RFP process.\n\nPROPOSITION HHH HOUSING PROJECT TIMELINES\n\nThe typical development process for government-funded supportive or affordable housing is a complex, multiyear endeavor—even under the best of circumstances. During our initial review of Proposition HHH, LAHD estimated that projects would take between three and six years from conceptualization to occupancy. While several of the factors that contribute to the timeline are outside of the City’s direct control, the timeline is not reflective of the ongoing homeless emergency in Los Angeles. At the current trajectory, several thousand unhoused residents will die before HHH-funded housing projects are completed.\n\nAt a high level, the process for projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline is comprised of four phases.\n\nThe City is typically not involved in the initial planning phase and LAHSA is responsible for the lease up process through its Coordinated Entry System (CES). For purposes of this review, we focused on measuring the length of time projects spend in pre-development and construction. While each project is different, there are some common factors that drive overall timelines during these phases.\n\nProject funding/financing – Because Proposition HHH funds make up only a portion of total costs and are awarded at the early stages of the development process, the City provides developers with conditional funding commitments which are good for up to two years. Developers spend that time assembling the remaining funding/financing to make their projects viable and compliant with established loan requirements.\nPermitting and entitlements – Proposition HHH developers must obtain the necessary land use approvals and permits to build their project. This requires navigating their project through several City departments and bureaus, such as Planning, Building and Safety, Public Works, Fire, Water and Power, and Transportation. This process also includes community outreach and addressing any lawsuits or design changes resulting from stakeholder input.\nConstruction – The construction process for Proposition HHH-funded housing projects is similar to other types of multifamily infill construction. Unexpected issues may emerge which require further coordination with City departments or other governmental entities.\n\nThe early stages of the pandemic further complicated most aspects of Proposition HHH housing development. Staffing challenges in the City and other entities impacted workflows, funders revised application deadlines, and social distancing requirements affected construction worksites. The overall volatility and uncertainty contributed to the Mayor’s decision to suspend all deadlines related to financing and pre-development activities necessary to develop or rehabilitate affordable and supportive housing (known as a “tolling order”). As a result, developers approaching the expiration of their two-year window to assemble financing and obtain permits could continue the process without obtaining a formal extension or losing their conditional funding commitment.\n\nDevelopment timelines for Proposition HHH housing projects continue to grow—more than half of all units have estimated completion dates of January 2023 or later\n\nOur previous review of Proposition HHH included an analysis of the average number of years required to complete a project, from issuance of the letter of commitment to the ready for occupancy date. Three projects had been completed until that point and they took an average of 2.8 years. It is important to note that funding commitments for those projects were not “first-in”, and therefore may not be fully representative of typical LAHD/HHH projects. The remaining 108 projects had an estimated timeline of 3.9 years.\n\nWe used a similar process to develop estimated timelines during this review. The table below shows estimated timelines for 15 projects completed since August 2020 and the remaining projects that are currently in construction or pre-development.\n\nThe estimated increase for projects in progress is being driven by additional time spent in the pre-development phase. Completed projects began construction approximately 435 days after receiving a letter of commitment from the City. Estimates for projects in progress are almost 900 days to reach the same milestone.\n\nThe following graph provides a snapshot of all 7,227 housing units currently in the LAHD/HHH pipeline and their actual/estimated dates of completion. Half of the total units have estimated completion dates of January 2023 or later.\n\nTIMELINES FOR PROPOSITION HHH HOUSING CHALLENGE PROJECTS\n\nThe HHH Housing Challenge established an aggressive two-year project completion timeline once developers received funding approvals from the City. The original goal—based on MOUs signed in January 2020—was for these projects to complete construction by the end of 2022.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic brought on several challenges. The Mayor’s emergency tolling order suspended deadlines to establish site control within four months of executing the MOU and the site selection process from some projects extended into 2021. Because HHH Housing Challenge projects are not eligible for conditional funding commitments until developers establish site control, these delays have had a significant impact on overall project timelines.\n\nRECOMMENDATION FOLLOW-UP\n\nOur previous reviews of Proposition HHH concluded that project costs were high and estimated timelines were not aligned with the urgency of the crisis. Although most Proposition HHH housing projects are currently in the construction phase, there are still opportunities to use remaining funding and any additional funding that may become available. Specific recommendations from our previous reviews are listed below, along with updates on the City’s progress toward implementation.\n\nThe City should evaluate the feasibility of reallocating some Proposition HHH funds that have been conditionally funded, especially funds committed to housing projects with outlier development costs. \t\n\nStatus: Not implemented\n\n \n\nThe City’s primary screening approach when funding projects through the LAHD/HHH pipeline is to consider whether the: developer has legal control of a site where a project can be built; project is financially feasible; and developer and service provider have successfully managed supportive housing projects. For the most part, actual project costs—merely an estimate at that stage—have not been an explicit part of the evaluation criteria.\n\nEven before the onset of the pandemic, project costs associated with several Proposition HHH supportive housing projects exceeded reasonable expectations. This trend has continued and projects exceeding $600,000 per unit are no longer outliers. We recommended that the City explore the feasibility of reallocating funding commitments from some projects in the pre-development phase.\n\nThe City does not intend to implement this recommendation due to concerns that early cancellation of a funding commitment would compromise business relationships with supportive/affordable housing developers who have secured sites and worked in good faith to move projects forward. In addition, City officials expressed concern that withdrawing a funding commitment could create legal issues for the City.\n\nThe City should support efforts to streamline permitting and other processes to ensure that projects that are currently–or will soon be–in the development pipeline are completed as quickly as possible.\t\n\nStatus: In progress\n\n \n\nOur 2019 review of Proposition HHH highlighted some of the City’s longstanding challenges with timely and efficient permitting processes for developing multifamily housing projects. The Mayor issued Executive Directive #13 (ED13) in October 2015 to facilitate streamlined and prioritized case processing for all affordable housing developments. Although it was issued before Proposition HHH, the strategies outlined in ED13 apply to supportive housing developments.\n\nDespite ED13 and other efforts to expedite projects, respondents to a 2019 survey on Proposition HHH provided critical feedback that indicated much more needed to be done. A 2020 survey of developers by LAHD identified multiple issues, including accessibility reviews and a lack of prioritization in multiple City departments despite existing policy requirements.\n\nWe recommended that the City take the following steps.\n\nExpand the scope of authority of Executive Directive 13 by establishing priority case processing in other City departments such as Engineering, Department of Water and Power, and Fire Department.\nRequire departments to provide recurring public updates regarding their progress on moving Proposition HHH housing developments to completion.\nIncrease the number of dedicated staff across multiple departments to shepherd supportive housing projects through the approvals process.\n\nThe Mayor issued Executive Directive #30 (ED30) in April 2021. ED30 was developed with the underlying premise that ED13 was insufficient to meet the City’s housing challenges. The directive included a larger number of participating departments and expanded the Mayor’s Affordable Housing Cabinet which consists of assigned liaisons and senior personnel tasked with troubleshooting and promoting interdepartmental coordination.\n\nED30 also outlines a process where developers of multifamily housing projects that have ten or more units and at least 20% of total units designated as affordable (i.e., income-restricted) are eligible for prioritized case processing. But it does not provide an additional tier and further prioritization for 100% affordable projects developed through Proposition HHH.\n\nFor example, the directive states that the Department of Building & Safety shall reduce processing times for building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and grading permits by 25%, relative to other applications in the department. General Managers are expected to report their progress on a quarterly basis. Data recently presented by the Mayor’s Office to the Proposition HHH Citizens Oversight Committee indicated that multiple departments met or exceeded their target thresholds.\n\nThe City should do more to improve transparency around these issues. ED30 states that processing times provided in quarterly reports from assigned departments will be used to develop a Housing Scorecard on the Mayor’s website. This dashboard has not yet been completed or made publicly available.\n\nThe City should use remaining HHH funds—or any HHH funds that become available—to prioritize the development of facilities such as interim housing, clinics, storage, and showers to help better manage the immediate needs of Angelenos experiencing homelessness.\t\n\nStatus: Not Implemented\n\n \n\nOne of our primary concerns about Proposition HHH and the City’s approach to the homelessness crisis has been the strategic disconnect between the decision to focus almost exclusively on building housing—which takes several years—and the mounting death toll in the streets.\n\nMore than 95% of funds allocated through Proposition HHH have been set aside for supportive/affordable housing rather than interim housing or facilities such as restrooms, showers, and storage. Because building housing has been the clear priority, the City suspended its Proposition HHH facilities program in 2018.\nWhile more HHH-funded housing projects will be placed into service in the coming months, only 1,142 units have been completed since the ballot measure was approved. Meanwhile, thousands of unhoused residents have died in Los Angeles County during that same period.\n\nEven after housing being built through Proposition HHH is completed, it is likely that tens of thousands of people will remain unsheltered. A critical question has been—and continues to be—what should the City do to help people while they wait for housing to be built?\n\nWe recommended that the City take a more balanced approach and use additional Proposition HHH funding to develop interim housing and other facilities. While stopgap measures will not end homelessness in Los Angeles, providing short-term help would allow unhoused residents to meet their basic sanitation needs and obtain onsite access to services. For several years, the City’s production of interim housing consisted of congregate shelter beds developed through the A Bridge Home program. Developing these facilities was helpful, but the effort fell far short of accommodating tens of thousands of unsheltered Angelenos.\n\nIn March 2020, a coalition of Los Angeles stakeholders filed a lawsuit (LA Alliance for Human Rights, et. al. v. City of Los Angeles, et. al.) that accused the City and County of violating State and federal laws in their response to the homelessness crisis. While the legal proceedings continue to unfold, the City and County reached an agreement to provide 6,700 beds and services for people experiencing homelessness in the City of Los Angeles within 18 months. The agreement allows for a variety of housing interventions including hotel/motel rooms, tiny home villages, sprung structures/tents, and safe parking. The City has spent the last several months bringing these facilities into service, but funds from Proposition HHH have not been used.\n\nThe City should prioritize acquisition, rehabilitation, or adaptive reuse opportunities with remaining HHH funds or HHH funds that become available.\t\n\nStatus: In progress\n\n \n\nAt the time of our last report (September 2020), the City had tentative plans to allocate approximately $30 million in uncommitted HHH funds to solicit proposals for new projects using the same process which had been used during previous funding cycles for the LAHD/HHH pipeline. We argued that the public health emergency and economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic called for a different strategy, especially since the status quo was resulting in high project costs and lengthy development timelines.\n\nWe recommended that the City focus on acquiring and converting existing properties—such as hotels and motels—because it would likely mitigate the impact of rising construction costs and land use issues that add time and money to projects. Most importantly, it would help move unsheltered residents into housing faster. But this alternate approach presented its own set of potential issues. Some hotels and motels function as housing of last resort for vulnerable residents, so steps would need to be taken to prevent displacing those individuals. In addition, the City would incur costs to retrofit older buildings to meet modern accessibility and fire safety requirements. Despite these challenges, the practicality of this approach has been reinforced since we issued our last report.\n\nPROJECT HOMEKEY PHASE 1\n\nAs part of its pandemic response, the State launched a program (“Project Homekey”) which made funding available to local governmental entities to acquire properties and quickly house people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. Entities participating in the program were typically required to provide local matching funds and eligible projects included properties that could immediately be used as supportive housing or temporarily used as interim housing and later converted to permanent.\n\nAccording to data provided by the City, ten hotels/motels were acquired using a combination of State/City emergency pandemic funding during the first phase of Project Homekey. An additional five properties were acquired without State funding. Altogether, these properties will provide 891 units at a total cost approximately $198 million—or approximately $223,000 per unit.\n\nThese per unit costs are significantly lower than LAHD/HHH Primary Development Pipeline projects that are currently in construction (approximately $596,000/unit). In addition, the 891 units acquired in the span of six months is nearly 80% of what the LAHD/HHH Primary Development Pipeline has produced (1,142 units) in more than five years. But there are key distinctions that need to be considered to better contextualize any project cost and timeline comparisons.\n\nMost of the hotels/motels acquired through this program will be used as interim housing for between three and five years and then converted to supportive housing. The projects being built through the LAHD/HHH pipeline are typically new construction and will function as supportive housing immediately after they are placed into service.\nThe acquisition costs listed above included approximately $22 million in facility rehabilitation costs (approximately $25,000 per unit) in order to meet basic ADA and fire safety requirements. According to the City, the additional costs to fully convert these facilities to supportive housing may be significant and are difficult to estimate because the conversions for most of the projects will not take place for several years.\nThe economic shock of the pandemic led to a large influx of federal funding to State and local governments, a portion of which was made available as grants to acquire these properties. This process is significantly faster than conventional project financing models that rely on federal tax credits and several different funding sources. The future success of this model is largely contingent on the availability of funding. In addition, the tourism industry experienced a significant downturn throughout 2020 and the uncertainty likely contributed to an unusually favorable market to acquire hotels/motels.\n\nGiven these factors, comparing Homekey Phase 1 projects to projects in the LAHD/HHH pipeline is not an apples-to-apples exercise. But the concept of quickly acquiring properties at lower costs and temporarily using them as interim housing before converting to supportive housing continues to show promise.\n\nPROJECT HOMEKEY PHASE 2\n\nThe State allocated an additional $2.75 billion for a second phase of Project Homekey based on the results from the initial phase of the program. The State allocated funds to local jurisdictions based on criteria that included the number of unhoused residents—approximately $358 million was set aside for Los Angeles County.  \n\nIn October 2021, LAHD obtained authorization to apply for funding and submitted a preliminary plan to acquire 750 units of supportive housing. Based on the information reported by LAHD, there were two key distinctions from the initial phase of Project Homekey.\n\nProposition HHH funds were included, along with other sources, to meet the matching requirements.\nLAHD prioritized newly-built apartment buildings without tenants and extended stay hotels because both types of properties would likely require less rehabilitation work and could function as supportive housing faster than sites acquired during the first phase of Project Homekey. Potential properties were identified by Council Offices or real estate brokers.\n\nIn February 2022, LAHD reported back to the Council and identified specific properties to acquire using funds from Project Homekey, Proposition HHH, and other sources. The proposed acquisition plan includes nine properties at a total cost of approximately $427 million. There are 868 units spread across these sites and the estimated cost per unit is $492,000. Consistent with the strategy outlined in October 2021, the properties include a mix of newly-built apartment buildings and extended stay hotels. The table below provides basic details about these potential acquisitions.\n\nThe City’s proposed plan is to use the remaining uncommitted Proposition HHH funds (approximately $80 million) to acquire these properties. Beyond the lower cost per unit, these projects will likely be placed into service within the span of months—in sharp contrast to most housing projects funded through Proposition HHH.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe passage of Proposition HHH remains a critical moment in the City’s recent history. It facilitated the development of thousands of units of housing that will help unhoused residents and people at risk of homelessness. Our previous reviews of Proposition HHH highlighted gaps in the City’s overall strategy and issues—some of which are outside the City’s direct control—that contribute to expensive projects and lengthy development timelines. During this review, we found that less than 1,200 units have been produced in five years and estimated costs for several projects exceed $700,000 per unit.\n\nEven after all HHH-funded housing projects are completed, it is likely that significantly more Angelenos will be experiencing homelessness compared to when the ballot measure was approved. Each day spent without housing or shelter puts those individuals at risk for tragic outcomes. While future plans have not been finalized, building tens of thousands of additional units using the same model will likely cost billions of dollars and will take far too long to match the urgency of the ongoing homeless emergency. Going forward, we continue to urge the City to pursue more balanced approaches and find ways to scale up faster and cheaper projects.\n\nPROPOSITION HHH FINANCIAL AUDIT\n\nClick here to read the latest Prop.

Click again to collapse.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn March 2020, a coalition of Los Angeles stakeholders filed a lawsuit (LA Alliance for Human Rights, et. al. v. City of Los Angeles, et. al.) that accused the City of Los Angeles (City) and County of Los Angeles (County) of violating State and federal laws in their response to the homelessness crisis. The original lawsuit and subsequent orders by the Court spurred discussions about issues such as structural racism, housing, control of public space, property rights, accessibility rights, mental health, addiction, public health, and use of taxpayer funds. While the underlying causes of the crisis are complex and represent policy failures across multiple levels of government, Angelenos generally agree that the status quo is unacceptable.\n\nDespite years of unprecedented investment and attention, Los Angeles County remains the epicenter of the State’s homelessness crisis. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health estimated that approximately four unhoused individuals died every day in 2019 and preliminary reporting suggests that the trend has continued during the ensuing period. The most recent point-in-time count (conducted in January 2020) showed that tens of thousands of people were living in the streets without housing or shelter. Several years of data show a deepening crisis and the continued economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic further threatens vulnerable residents who face housing instability.\n\nA key question posed by the LA Alliance lawsuit is whether the City is doing enough to help unhoused residents while waiting for long-term strategies—primarily development of supportive housing funded by Proposition HHH—to deliver results. Given the increasingly untenable situation in Skid Row and other Los Angeles neighborhoods, U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter issued an injunction in April 2021 that called for:\n\ncompletion of multiple audits/investigations into City and County programs designed to alleviate homelessness (e.g., Proposition HHH and Measure H), as well as funds used for mental health or substance abuse treatment; and\ntimelines to offer/provide housing, shelter, or treatment services to unhoused residents of Skid Row.\n\nThe injunction also stated, “…City Controller Ron Galperin shall oversee the creation of a report on all land potentially available within each district for housing and sheltering the homeless of each district.” Subsequent discussion with the Court clarified that the scope of the order was limited to properties owned by the City.\n\nThe request stemmed from our Office’s previous work on the issue, which included building an inventory of publicly-owned properties and developing recommendations about how the City should strategically manage its real estate assets. We originally launched the Property Panel in 2017 and our 2019 update identified more than 14,000 government owned properties in Los Angeles. Approximately 7,500 of these properties were owned by the City itself. The remaining properties were owned by the federal government, State of California, County of Los Angeles, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro).\n\nDiscussions surrounding the City’s approach to homelessness have continued to evolve—both inside and outside of the courtroom.\n\nIn May 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered an administrative stay (i.e., hold) on Judge Carter’s injunction and the Court eventually vacated the order. In November 2021, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint intended to address some of the procedural and evidentiary concerns highlighted by the Ninth Circuit. Barring a settlement, the legal process will continue to play out over the next several months.\nThe City initiated significant changes to its camping laws throughout the summer of 2021. The City now has the authority to prohibit unhoused individuals from sitting, lying, sleeping, or storing their property in the public right-of-way near: (1) sensitive sites such as schools, parks, and libraries; (2) underpasses, overpasses, or ramps; (3) facilities that provide homeless services or shelters opened after January 2018; and (4) portions of the public right-of-way that the City identifies due to threats to public health or safety. To date, the City has designated—or is considering—hundreds of sites under this new framework.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of the LA Alliance lawsuit remains unclear, but the growing number of restricted zones established by the City raises questions about where unhoused people can legally sit, lie, and sleep. In addition, the City’s efforts to develop supportive housing using funds from Proposition HHH is beset with high costs, lengthy timelines, and will not produce nearly enough units for everyone in need.\n\nGiven these issues, it is critical to identify vacant or underutilized City-owned properties that should be considered for interim shelter or support facilities. This report is intended to fulfill Judge Carter’s original request and provide additional context about the City’s efforts to assess its properties. \n\nCity efforts to develop housing and shelter on City-owned property in recent years  \n\nDeveloping supportive and affordable housing is a key component of the City’s overall homelessness strategy. As a result, large parcels of City-owned land which are centrally located and do not require extensive site preparation are often designated for construction of housing projects using bond proceeds from Proposition HHH or other funding streams. This approach is intended to leverage existing City assets and lower development costs.\n\nAs of June 2021, there were 16 projects in the Proposition HHH pipeline being developed on City-owned property. These properties include Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) parking lots and properties formerly controlled by the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles. When completed, these projects will provide approximately 1,074 units of housing for the target population.\n\nBut the magnitude of the crisis also requires a mix of short-term strategies to help unhoused residents in need and to ensure that public space such as sidewalks, parks, and streets are safe and clean for all residents. Over the last several years, the City directed multiple teams and working groups (e.g., Interim Housing and Temporary Structures Working Group) to focus on issues such as interim housing and property management. These efforts led to development of new interim housing sites, some of which are located on City-owned property.\n\nA Bridge Home – In 2018, the City launched the A Bridge Home program, which included installation of modular trailers or membrane structure to provide temporary shelter, storage, and supportive services for unhoused residents. The program was designed to provide participants with short-term transitional housing (typically between three and six months) while they wait for housing to become available.\n\nAs of June 2021, the City completed 31 bridge housing facilities—11 of which were developed on properties controlled by City departments. The remaining projects were built on properties owned by other public entities (e.g., Metro, Caltrans) or private entities.\n\nCOVID-19 Homelessness Roadmap – The first half of 2020 brought the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the influx of emergency funding, and an urgent need to find emergency shelter for high-risk unhoused individuals. The convergence of these factors spurred an increase in the number of planned interim housing projects, along with efforts to identify vacant or underutilized City-owned properties. In addition, concerns about COVID-19 transmission resulted in a greater focus on interim housing in non-congregate settings.\n\nThe City and County reached an agreement (Roadmap) in June 2020 to develop 6,700 housing interventions within 18 months to address the COVID-19 emergency. The Roadmap allows for several different types of interventions (e.g., beds in A Bridge Home facilities, safe parking sites, tiny home villages, motel rooms, permanent housing) to count toward the overall goal.\n\nSince the agreement was reached, several City departments—primarily the City Administrative Officer (CAO), Chief Legislative Analyst (CLA), Bureau of Engineering (BOE), and General Services Department (GSD)—have worked with Council Offices and other stakeholders to identify and evaluate potential sites. These efforts, and operating funds from the County, facilitated the development of several interim housing locations, some of which are on property owned by the City.\n\nFurther analysis is required to better understand costs associated with developing/operating these types of sites and measuring outcomes for participants. For example, the Safe Sleeping pilot program listed in the table has a projected monthly cost of $2,600 per-person, per-space—which raises questions about the long-term viability of the program, relative to other options. But the City’s alternate approach has typically meant leaving individuals without adequate shelter and sanitation while they wait for housing placements that may take years to materialize.\n\nProcesses to determine which City-owned properties are considered for alternate uses\n\nThe City’s efforts to identify and assess properties for economic development or other purposes are guided by its Asset Evaluation Framework. The evaluation process is initiated when a proposed re-use of a City-owned property is transmitted to the CAO’s Asset Management Strategic Planning (AMSP) unit. The AMSP unit’s role differs from GSD, which is the City’s property manager, maintains the inventory of properties, and performs real estate transactions on behalf of the City.\n\nThe AMSP unit works with City stakeholders to consider a series of factors during its evaluation, including municipal uses currently operating on site and whether those uses are necessary or can be relocated. Recommendations from AMSP are forwarded to the Municipal Facilities Committee (comprised of representatives from the CAO, CLA, and Mayor) for review. Actions recommended by the Municipal Facilities Committee are submitted to the Council for consideration.\n\nThe process for identifying viable City-owned sites to develop temporary shelter is mostly consistent with the principles outlined in the Asset Evaluation Framework. But there are additional feasibility considerations and criteria to account for the unique nature of emergency/temporary housing facilities such as bridge shelters, tiny home villages, safe sleeping, and safe parking.\n\nThe graphic below summarizes the assessment process for City-owned properties, as reported by the CAO in February 2021. Sites are introduced for feasibility assessments by City Councilmembers or City departments, and corresponding Council Offices provide feedback throughout the process.\n\nChallenges to identifying and repurposing City-owned properties for housing or shelter\n\nThe LA Alliance lawsuit spurred discussions about whether the City is doing enough to tackle homelessness using its own properties, which raises larger questions about how the City manages its vast real estate portfolio. The City’s longstanding approach has been fragmented and not optimized to pursue strategic opportunities to revitalize underutilized properties, acquire new land/real estate, or dispose of existing assets. Overall, this limits the City’s economic development potential and prevents reinvestment of real estate revenue into new projects.\n\nTo address these—and other real estate management issues—our Office recommended the creation of a new entity called the Los Angeles Municipal Development Corporation (LAMDC). As envisioned, the governance structure of LAMDC would include City officials tasked with advancing public interest goals in partnership with experts from the financial and real estate sectors. The LAMDC is modeled, in part, on leading entities in other jurisdictions, while incorporating features unique to the City of Los Angeles to best serve the needs of the City, stakeholders, and residents.\n\nIn the context of the ongoing shelter emergency, potential sites—both publicly- and privately-owned—are being evaluated by the City on a parcel-by-parcel basis. According to a February 2021 CAO report on the City’s efforts to identify properties to contribute to homeless interventions, 100 locations were deemed infeasible for a variety of underlying reasons. Some of the challenges associated with the City-owned properties, as well as other relevant obstacles, are outlined below.\n\nAsset management system – GSD is responsible for maintaining an inventory of the City’s real estate assets. Tracking the status, conditions, and uses of more than 8,000 City-owned properties within Los Angeles County poses challenges. While GSD centrally tracks real estate asset information in its Asset Management System, GSD relies in part on departments to update information about the properties under their control. As a result, real estate asset data can contain errors, and departments sometimes fail to update information in a timely manner.\n\nDepartmental operations – Decisions about the feasibility of repurposing vacant or surplus City-owned land depend on factors such as lot size, nearby amenities, and infrastructure conditions. If the minimum criteria are met and requisite approvals are obtained, the site can be prepared for conversion to bridge housing, safe parking, safe sleeping, or tiny home village.\n\nBut the task becomes markedly more challenging when the location is tied to departmental operations. For example, a lightly used maintenance yard may be a viable location for interim housing, but the affected department would need to modify its operations to account for the repurposing of the location.\n\nCommunity opposition – The City’s ability to identify and convert vacant or underutilized property for supportive housing or interim housing interventions is further complicated by residents, businesses, or local organizations who oppose those efforts. Opposition can come from stakeholders who contend that these projects should be developed in other areas, or others who contend that resources allocated to interim housing impedes long-term solutions like supportive housing.\n\nWhether through formal appeals of land use decisions or less formal means like social media, residents, businesses, and local organizations wield significant influence about which locations are considered. Ultimately, the pushback can shrink the number of projects that are selected for initial feasibility assessments or prevent viable projects from moving forward.\n\nSite characteristics – There are a variety of reasons why a vacant or underutilized City property may be deemed infeasible. Because larger and centrally located sites are typically set aside for affordable/supportive housing development, many of the remaining properties present their own site-specific challenges such as inadequate size, irregular layout, wildfire risks, pollution risks, ADA issues, or other regulatory hurdles. Sites that do not have easy access to essential infrastructure such as power, water, and sewer will typically require site preparation that makes the project cost prohibitive.\n\nProprietary departments – Management of property asset data is particularly challenging for the City’s proprietary departments. These entities own or control thousands of parcels of land, much of which supports their management of critical infrastructure and transportation systems.\n\nGiven the scope and nature of capital improvement projects and upgrades taking place at the LAX, the Port of LA, and across the City’s power and water systems, it can be difficult to ensure information about properties such as their condition, and future plans for sites, is up to date and accurate. In addition, these properties are typically subject to a greater number of regulatory constraints compared to properties controlled by Council-controlled departments.\n\nAREAS OF OPPORTUNITY\n\nThe information in the subsections below is intended to provide a point-in-time assessment on properties that should be considered for homeless housing interventions or support facilities. Our analysis was limited to properties within the City’s direct control, but properties owned/controlled by other public entities (e.g., LAUSD, Metro, Caltrans) should also be considered as part of a comprehensive approach to the issue.\n\nIt is critical to note that our process was limited to potential site identification. Actual determinations about habitability and feasibility cannot be made until subject matter experts in departments such as the Bureau of Engineering conduct formal assessments. A series of factors such as site layout, access to infrastructure, contamination/liability risks, impact on surrounding communities, and site preparation time/costs need to be considered.\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that we used minimum lot size criteria established by the City to identify potential sites. Other types of interim housing interventions may allow for greater density or smaller lot sizes.\n\nVacant City-owned properties – Judge Carter’s April 2021 injunction included City-owned properties that could be used for supportive/affordable housing. However, we primarily focused our efforts on City-owned sites that can be used to develop interim shelter because of the emergency nature of the situation and the relative speed at which interventions like tiny home villages, safe sleeping villages, and safe parking could be deployed.\n\nWe targeted approximately 6,000 City-owned properties which were flagged as vacant or did not have any known structures based on the database maintained by GSD. We focused on these locations because they are more likely to be available, and repurposing them would be less likely to disrupt ongoing City operations. Our methodology for identifying sites is outlined in the Appendix of this report and was based on the City’s process from the February 2021 CAO report. But there are some key issues that should be noted.\n\nThe City’s initial feasibility screening sets a minimum three-year threshold for site availability, with a preference for sites available for up to five years. Given the urgency of the situation, we reduced this threshold to one-year and provided controlling departments with an opportunity to provide feedback.\nSome of the sites we recommended for consideration have already been formally assessed by the City. We recommended that these sites get a second look based on information provided by controlling departments or different facility types that have emerged since the original assessment was completed. For example, sites previously ruled out for bridge housing may be suitable for safe parking or tiny home villages.\n\nOverall, we identified 26 City-owned sites which met our minimum criteria, may be habitable, and warrant formal assessment. Combined, these properties have potential to provide approximately 1.7 million square feet of space for interim housing or other types of facilities. Site profiles can be found in the Appendix of this report.\n\nIt is important to note that our Office evaluated properties based on data contained in the City’s property database, Los Angeles County Assessor records, and information about properties provided by City departments. Only properties meeting our minimum suitability criteria were considered, and our analysis did not consider the locations of the City’s potentially suitable properties. As a result, the properties identified during our research are not distributed evenly based on geographic parameters, such as Council Districts. Potentially feasible sites tend to be located in areas where the City owns large properties.\n\nAdditional analysis will be required to determine whether these potential sites are distributed equitably and overlap with areas where unhoused Angelenos are located.\n\nParker Center – The sheer magnitude of the homelessness crisis affects nearly every neighborhood in Los Angeles, but Skid Row has been ground zero for several decades. The most recent point-in-time count (conducted in January 2020) estimated that there were 4,662 unhoused people living in the area—more than 11% of the citywide homeless population. The conditions on Skid Row and impacts on community residents/businesses were the some of the stated reasons for the LA Alliance lawsuit. Following a tour of the neighborhood in late-2017, a United Nations (UN) official stated that the number of public toilets available to unhoused residents failed to meet minimum sanitation standards for UN refugee camps.\n\nMere blocks away from Skid Row sits once of the City’s most visible and centrally-located vacant parcels—the site of the former Parker Center (150 N. Los Angeles Street). Discussions about demolishing the building and constructing a new City facility in its place began as early as 2006. After several years of planning and consideration of options, the City decided to move forward with construction of a 753,740-square-foot office tower for City employees known as the Los Angeles Street Civic Building. The effort was embedded into the Civic Center Master Plan, which is a multi-year effort to add at least 1.2 million-square-feet of office space to the area around City Hall.\n\nDemolition of the Parker Center began in 2018 and was certified as complete as of February 2020. Concurrent with that process, the City developed and issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to identify a short-list of qualified teams to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain the newly constructed building. But the City canceled the RFQ due to concerns about project costs and uncertainty about potential savings associated with selling properties or terminating leases. In June 2020, the Council instructed BOE, CAO, and Economic Workforce Development Department to report back with procurement alternatives, but it does not appear that the request has been completed.\n\nThe Council recently approved a motion to explore redeveloping the Civic Center area by building 3.5 million-square-feet of housing and consolidating/building 1.5 million-square-feet of office space. Given that the larger redevelopment effort remains in flux, the Parker Center site will continue to sit dormant for an undetermined period of time. This lull presents the City with an opportunity to formally assess whether the site would be appropriate for interim housing (e.g., tiny homes, safe sleeping) or support facilities such as restrooms, showers, and laundry.\n\nBoth the location and size (> 100,000-square-feet) of the parcel are promising, but a formal assessment is needed to determine whether there are any significant contamination concerns or other issues that would make repurposing the site impractical or cost prohibitive. For example, the demolition and excavation process has left portions of the site below grade, which may present site preparation challenges.\n\nParking lots and underutilized properties – In addition to vacant sites or other large, unused properties, the City should consider repurposing underutilized properties to further support its homelessness initiatives. These types of sites are periodically evaluated, but establishing criteria and reporting requirements would help identify these sites on an ongoing basis.\n\nThough sometimes an overlooked asset, many of the City’s facilities have parking lots for employees, members of the public, or City fleet vehicles and equipment. Some parking lots associated with City facilities may already possess certain characteristics that could make them suitable for repurposing. They are flat, paved, and may be located close to existing power, water, and other utility assets, which makes it easier to prepare sites for homeless housing solutions. For example, a City-owned parking lot at 19020-19040 Vanowen Street in Council District 3 was repurposed for a tiny home village.\n\nOther large, flat, and paved spaces that are not specifically used for parking may also be suitable, such as underutilized service yard spaces. However, departments would need to carefully examine whether hosting homeless housing or safe parking programs would negatively impact operations, the safety employees or unhoused individuals, or City infrastructure.\n\nAirport properties – Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) is a proprietary department which maintains control of its own properties. LAWA officials reported airport properties generally cannot be used for homeless housing initiatives due to certain federal restrictions. The City would need to pay fair market value for any revenue generating LAWA properties converted to homeless housing. Another challenge is that some of the properties owned by LAWA were acquired due to public health concerns about noise or other issues.\n\nLAWA is currently working with the FAA to determine whether airport properties identified in conjunction with a City Council District can be used to support homeless housing programs–including parcels adjacent to LAX and Van Nuys Airport. The following properties are being considered for safe parking:\n\nPortion of Lot E, or construction support site north of Lot E (both sites not currently in use) – 5455 W. 111th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90045; and\nVan Nuys FlyAway Overflow Parking – 7691 Gloria Ave., Los Angeles, CA 91406.\n\nThese properties are being considered for tiny home villages:\n\nManchester Square – North of Century, east of Aviation, west of La Cienega; and\nNorthside Phase II – North of Westchester Blvd, east of Fire Station 5, west of La Tijera.\n\nIn addition, LAWA has significant aviation‐related landholdings in Palmdale. Much of that property is not currently in use and, although LAWA is exploring potential future uses, they likely would take some time to develop. In the past, LAWA has received inquiries from the County of Los Angeles regarding the potential utilization of some portion of the Palmdale landholdings for temporary homeless housing. The following Palmdale properties are being considered:\n\n4037 E Ave P-8, Palmdale, CA 93552; and\n39516 25th Street East, at P Street, Palmdale CA 93550.\n\nThe FAA’s initial response requested additional information about how long sites would be repurposed for and LAWA’s plan to secure and maintain sites. In addition, the FAA cautioned that it would not support a plan to house people in areas that have been previously determined to be—or soon will be—incompatible with residential use.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe Council should instruct the CAO—in coordination with departments such as BOE, GSD, City Planning, LADBS—to complete formal site assessments for the 26 properties listed in the Appendix of this report to determine whether they can be used for interim housing or support facilities.\nThe Council should instruct the CAO—in coordination with departments such as BOE, GSD, City Planning, LADBS—to complete a formal site assessment of the Parker Center site to determine whether it can be used for interim housing or support facilities on a temporary basis until redevelopment plans are finalized. The Council should also request that LAHSA report back with options about how the site can be used to assist unhoused Angelenos in the Skid Row and Civic Center area.\nThe Council should instruct the CLA to establish a City-led interagency working group/task force to address planning, coordination, and capacity issues related to homeless housing. The working group should specifically include, but not be limited to, federal agencies, State of California agencies, the County of Los Angeles, neighboring cities, and other public sector organizations, such as universities, utilities, and transportation agencies.\nThe Council should instruct the CAO, in conjunction with GSD, to establish guidelines for when a Council-controlled department should consider a property underutilized, and develop a process by which department property managers regularly report to CAO and GSD asset management groups any properties that may be underutilized. The process should prioritize identification of underutilized parking lots and maintenance yards.\nThe Boards of Commissioners for the Department of Water and Power, Los Angeles World Airports, and Port of Los Angeles should instruct their respective departments to develop a formal process by which each entity periodically evaluates properties to identify vacant, surplus, or underutilized sites that may be suitable for homelessness initiatives. The analysis should take into account any land use, revenue, or regulatory restrictions that apply to the proprietary departments’ assets.\nThe Board of Commissioners for Los Angeles World Airports should instruct the department to continue working with the FAA to obtain permission to repurpose the six sites currently being considered and to identify additional sites for review.\nAPPENDIX\n\nScope and Methodology – The initial property inventory provided by GSD included approximately 8,000 City-owned properties. We worked to clean/prepare the data and determined parcel sizes through a matching process with data from the Los Angeles County Assessor and other sources. Next, we identified properties that met key criteria:\n\nminimum 20,000 square feet lot size; and\nproperty status designated as “vacant” (i.e., unused) in the GSD database, properties without structure descriptions, and properties listed with an “unknown” status.\n\nAfter we identified a preliminary list of properties that met our minimum size (20,000 sq. feet) and status (vacant/unused) criteria, we reached out to the relevant City departments to obtain additional information about the property to determine suitability. This process also offered departments with an opportunity to suggest additional sites which may not have been identified during our analysis of GSD data.\n\nIs the property primarily under your department’s control?\nDoes the property have any buildings on it?\nIs the property vacant or unused land?\nDoes your department or the City have any plans to develop the property in the next year?\nAre there any public health, public safety, or environmental risks associated with the property?\nIs the property subject to legal/regulatory restrictions prohibiting its use for homeless housing or shelter?\nHas your department or the City ever considered using the property for homeless housing or shelter?\n\nFinally, we conducted site visits for selected sites to make basic observations about site conditions in accordance with guidance provided by BOE. These site visits and observations were preliminary in nature and are not intended to replace formal assessments for suitability by subject matter experts in City departments.\n\nResearch limitations – We did not include the properties of three City departments in our parcel-by-parcel analysis. However, it is important to note that this exclusion is not an indicator that these departments do not have an important role in assisting with the City’s overall effort to identify and evaluate its properties for interim shelter.\n\nRecreation and Parks – Although RAP manages more than 400 park sites—many with large open spaces—the City’s parks, recreational sites, and cultural centers host a wide variety of programs and events and are widely used by members of the community. As a result, these sites did not meet the vacant/unused criteria in our analysis. However, underutilized parking lots or operations yards on RAP-controlled property may be appropriate.\n\nDepartment of Water and Power – We sought from LADWP additional clarifying information for approximately 600 properties. However, the complex nature of the department’s infrastructure assets made obtaining information about each site from managers and technical specialists from across the water and power systems difficult. LADWP representatives noted that open spaces owned by the department are often not well-suited for housing because the sites host critical infrastructure, some of which can be underground.\n\nLos Angeles World Airports – We did not assess the suitability of LAWA properties as part of our review. LAWA officials reported that the use of airport land is under the oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and, generally, airport properties cannot be used for housing due to grant assurances that set forth incompatible land uses; FAA requirements that the airport receive fair market value for the use of their property; specific grant assurances that preclude the erecting of structures or bringing together person, accept for the parking of automobiles; and/or other FAA rules and regulations regarding the use of airport land.\n\nResults – Overall, we identified 26 vacant/unused City-owned sites which met our minimum criteria, may be habitable, and warrant formal assessment. Although entire sites may not be buildable or suitable for housing or other facilities, the combined parcel square footage for the locations we identified is approximately 1.7 million square feet.\n\nThe property profiles that follow provide basic information about the sites and potential issues affecting site viability. We recommend that the City undertake formal assessments of these sites to determine whether they can used for bridge housing, safe parking, safe sleeping villages, or tiny home villages.\n\nView a list of the identified 26 vacant/unused City-owned sites."

      "textofpage": "Report\n\nLos Angeles has long struggled to keep its sidewalks accessible and safe for pedestrians. Historically, the City’s sidewalk repair programs have been insufficient in size and scope. While that has changed recently, the City’s sidewalk problems have grown. The shortcomings of the City’s current sidewalk strategy is the subject of this report.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThrough recent initiatives such as Vision Zero, Great Streets, and the Mobility element of the General Plan, the City has laid out a vision for Los Angeles that is less car-dependent. Making room for other modes of travel can help to make the City more mobile, accessible, and equitable for all Angelenos. A common element to realizing each of these important initiatives is how the City manages sidewalks and other pedestrian facilities.\n\nBased on recent mapping efforts, there are at least 9,000 linear sidewalk miles in the City, cumulatively equivalent to 11 square miles of concrete. Los Angeles, like many other cities, struggles to keep sidewalks accessible and safe to use. However, the City’s problematic relationship with sidewalks is magnified by years of neglect and confusion over who is liable for maintenance. In the last five fiscal years alone, the City received more than 1,700 claims and 1,020 lawsuits for sidewalk injuries, and paid out over $35 million in settlements as a result.\n\nAs commonplace as these individual claims and lawsuits have become, they are still only a microcosm of the widespread sidewalk issues facing the City. One lawsuit, however, made clear how decades of deferred sidewalk maintenance have systemically impacted accessibility throughout all of Los Angeles.\n\nFiled against the City in 2010, the Willits class action lawsuit alleged disability rights violations based on the poor condition of sidewalks and other pedestrian infrastructure. The case resulted in a historic settlement agreement that was finalized in 2016. The Willits settlement requires the City to expend $1.37 billion over 30 years to address broken sidewalks, inaccessible curb ramps, and other barriers to access in the pedestrian public right-of-way (PROW).  Any work performed by the City’s Sidewalk Repair Program must comply with disabled access standards to be eligible for the Willits settlement annual commitment.\n\nThe Council also adopted a “Fix-and-Release” policy in 2016 with the goal of repairing all sidewalks in Los Angeles. To clear up confusion over who is responsible for maintenance, the Council adopted an ordinance that effectively makes the City responsible for sidewalk repairs first. Under Fix-and-Release, the City will only start to enforce the property owner’s duty to maintain sidewalks after it has made the initial repair, issued a sidewalk certificate of compliance, and a limited-time warranty for one additional repair has expired as applicable.\n\nLeading the City’s efforts to comply with the Willits settlement is the Public Works Department, with its Bureau of Engineering (BOE) serving as the program manager for the new Sidewalk Repair Program. On March 30, 2016, City Council actions (Council File 14-0163-S3) instructed the BOE to implement the program consistent with the approved Willits Term Sheet, which is also consistent with the annual budgets adopted for the Sidewalk Repair Program. Unfortunately, the scale of the problem combined with the challenges presented by the City’s approach, means progress has been slow, leaving the City’s sidewalk maintenance backlog as daunting as ever.\n\nMeanwhile, our sidewalk infrastructure continues to deteriorate and everyone—especially people with mobility challenges—continues to struggle. Absent a significant influx of funding, we recommend that decision-makers resolve this dilemma by revisiting the Fix-and-Release policy and changing the City’s approach to sidewalk repair. \n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nThrough the Sidewalk Repair Program, the City has completed construction at over 2,100 sites encompassing sidewalks that cross over thousands of property parcels. However, Public Works has struggled to keep up with the overwhelming demand. Public Works has received over 3,800 access requests and 4,400 rebate applications, and has identified approximately 2,700 Council-controlled City facilities that it must evaluate and address.\n\nConsistent with the City’s Fix-and-Release policy, Public Works has also issued sidewalk certificates of compliance for each property parcel where construction is completed, which begins the process of “releasing” sidewalk repair responsibilities to the property owner. As of December 2020, Public Works has issued about 4,500 certificates, equal to less than 1% of the 640,000 parcels with sidewalks in Los Angeles.\n\nTwo major issues are affecting the City’s ability to address more sidewalk defects:\n\nFix-and-Release requires more work than is necessary in some cases — To issue sidewalk certificates under the Fix-and-Release framework, Public Works assesses the entire sidewalk within the parcel lines of a property for compliance with accessibility standards. When applied to the built environment of an entire parcel, Public Works has found that many existing sidewalk locations do not meet current disabled access standards and therefore must go through an extensive pre-construction and construction process that often removes and replaces the sidewalk in its entirety in order to issue a sidewalk certificate of compliance. While the Willits settlement generally requires the City to improve all sidewalks adjacent to City facilities in order to bring them into compliance with accessibility standards, the same is not the case for non-City facility parcels. When performing sidewalk repair work at locations other than City facilities, neither the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) nor the Willits settlement agreement require the City to repair the entirety of existing sidewalks on parcels. They also do not require the City to issue certificates of compliance or to fix and release responsibility to the property owner. However, this is currently the practice under the Fix-and-Release policy. Changing the City’s sidewalk inspection and prioritization criteria to focus on significant defects would give Public Works more discretion to focus only on what is required by the Willits settlement.\nMore investments should be made for basic maintenance — Beyond access requests, rebate applications, and sidewalk repairs adjacent to City facilities, there are an additional 50,000 reports of sidewalk problems that are not being addressed by the Sidewalk Repair Program. According to Public Works Bureau of Streets Services (StreetsLA) managers, they do not have a program with dedicated resources for these problems, and addresses these sidewalk reports with short-term asphalt maintenance repairs as a temporary stopgap measure. In FY 2021, StreetsLA took an average of 41 calendar days to close sidewalk requests with a temporary asphalt maintenance repair. The City needs to do more to address these requests and complete short-term repairs in a timely manner, as these repairs reduce tripping hazards. The City should also invest more in long-term concrete repairs, and consider conducting a sidewalk and curb ramp assessment separate from the Willits settlement-focused Sidewalk Repair Program to identify and prioritize locations that have the greatest need.\nWHAT WE RECOMMEND\n\nEven the Willits settlement’s $1.37 billion 30-year obligation may not be enough to address decades of insufficient sidewalk maintenance. The City should change its Fix-and-Release policy and invest more to make the sidewalk system safer for pedestrian use. Specifically, we recommend that the City consider the following:\n\nAmend Los Angeles Municipal Code 62.104 to include new sidewalk inspection criteria that identifies significant defects for repair, instead of assessing the entire sidewalk for compliance with accessibility standards;\nModify the prioritization system so that project prioritization categories other than City facilities can also be considered for the Sidewalk Repair Program;\nExercise its discretion so that more sidewalk repairs can move forward, while minimizing to the greatest extent possible the need for the extensive pre-construction process;\nExpand StreetsLA’s capacity to provide timelier short-term responses to reported sidewalk problems;\nImplement long-term sidewalk repair solutions in coordination with the Willits-focused Sidewalk Repair Program;\nComplete a sidewalk and curb ramp condition assessment to identify high priority sidewalk and curb ramp locations to contribute towards meeting the City’s ADA obligations; and\nPursue additional funding opportunities to address the backlog of sidewalk requests and support a sidewalk and curb ramp condition assessment.\n\nAngelenos have endured the City’s inadequate management of sidewalks for decades, and a sidewalk system that is more usable and accessible, when viewed in its entirety, is long overdue. By implementing the recommendations in this report, the City will have a more comprehensive and practical approach to sidewalk repair and maintenance going forward.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City holds the rights over streets, parkways, sidewalks, and other elements that collectively form the public right-of-way (PROW) and mainly serve to facilitate public travel. As a public space for all Angelenos, the PROW is affected by a complex array of issues, including sidewalk vendors and on-demand e-scooters. Some issues that intersect with the PROW, such as homelessness, are particularly difficult and do not come with any easy solutions.\n\nThe City exercises control over this public space by passing and enforcing ordinances that govern what is allowed or required in the PROW. Sidewalk vending permits, on-demand mobility rules and guidelines, and anti-camping ordinances are just a few recent examples related to sidewalks. The PROW’s usability and accessibility are also affected by how well the City maintains supporting infrastructure such as sidewalks.\n\nHowever, the City’s sidewalk repair programs have historically been insufficient in size and scope. Plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit of Willits v. Los Angeles alleged that the City’s broken sidewalks, inaccessible curb ramps, and a generally widespread level of disrepair in the pedestrian PROW amounted to discrimination against people with mobility disabilities.\n\nThe alleged discrimination, if proven at trial, would have resulted in a legal finding that the City violated the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other disability rights laws. Instead, the case was settled in 2016. The resulting Willits settlement agreement requires the City to invest at least $1.37 billion over 30 years to remediate existing barriers to access in the pedestrian PROW in compliance with disabled access standards.\n\nConcurrently, policymakers adopted a new City policy for sidewalk repair. Under the City Council’s “Fix-and-Release” policy, the City intends to inspect and repair all sidewalks throughout Los Angeles, with the goal of eventually transferring that responsibility to abutting property owners. LA Municipal Code (LAMC) 62.104 was revised to enact Fix-and-Release, and it went into effect January 2017. The City began its Willits settlement 30-year compliance period in July 2017.\n\nTo both comply with the Willits settlement and implement Fix-and-Release, the City established the Sidewalk Repair Program. Monitoring the City’s compliance with the settlement agreement is the exclusive purview of the Willits class, their legal counsel, and the Federal Court’s Central District of California. Separately, the City is under litigation over its recently completed environmental impact report study for sidewalk repairs. This report focuses on assessing the City’s progress under Fix-and-Release, and providing recommendations to improve sidewalk maintenance.\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF USABLE AND ACCESSIBLE SIDEWALKS\n\nSidewalks, like all capital assets, degrade over time and require maintenance to extend their useful life. Through age, ground settlement, or other natural processes, sidewalks can become cracked, broken, shifted, or uplifted. The root systems of City trees, construction, and other external factors can also damage sidewalks. Whatever the cause, sidewalk defects can and do become a dangerous hazard if left unaddressed.\n\nThe City is often held responsible for injuries caused by sidewalk defects. Injured parties who can prove that the City was negligent or had sufficient notice of a dangerous condition on a property in the City’s control may receive compensation for their injuries. In the last five fiscal years, the City received over 1,700 claims and 1,020 lawsuits for sidewalk injuries, and paid out more than $35 million in settlements.\n\nSurveys and needs assessments commissioned by the City also show that sidewalk repairs are top of mind for many residents. The City Administrative Officer’s 2017 FUSE fellow report evaluated the state of street-related infrastructure and found that sidewalk repair, along with tree trimming and street repair, were among the top three services that constituents wanted to be improved. According to the Community Investment for Families Department (formerly part of the Housing and Community Investment Department), residents have often said sidewalk improvements and reconstruction were a top concern during community needs assessments.\n\nFor persons with mobility disabilities, accessible sidewalks are even more important. Sidewalks with uplifts, cracks, excessive slopes, and other issues, are physical barriers that disproportionately impact pedestrians who have limited mobility, individuals who have low vision or are blind, and/or people who have other disabilities. Missing sidewalks and curb ramps, or poorly designed curb ramps are also major obstacles. These barriers to access inhibit or prevent persons with mobility disabilities from freely traveling in the pedestrian PROW. The ADA, like other civil rights laws, requires state and local governments to remove barriers so that historically marginalized and disenfranchised people can participate and integrate with mainstream American society.\n\nRepairing sidewalks is both a safety issue and a matter of civil rights that impacts all Angelenos. The US Census Bureau estimates that 10% of residents in LA County have a disability, including 5.7% who experience mobility difficulties. The prevalence of mobility disabilities also increases significantly with age, affecting 35% of LA County residents 75 and over.\n\nTHE CITY’S SIDEWALK REPAIR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe City is primarily responsible for ensuring that sidewalks in the PROW are in a state of good repair. The State’s sidewalk maintenance law allows local governments to impose a duty onto property owners to repair sidewalks adjacent to their property. Within this framework, local governments are still responsible for making repairs if notified property owners do not do so in a timely manner. Many cities throughout California have adopted the State’s sidewalk maintenance law or enacted similar ordinances. In adopting the Fix-and-Release policy, the City’s goal is to eventually make property owners responsible for repair by:\n\nHowever, imposing sidewalk repair responsibilities onto property owners does not transfer or diminish the City’s essential responsibility to ensure that sidewalks are safe and usable. In the case of Lenahan v. Schaefer (1944), the California Court of Appeals made it clear that municipalities have an “unconditional and unquestioned” obligation to make sidewalk repairs, and that the State’s sidewalk maintenance law does not transfer or “relieve the city of that primary duty and responsibility.”\n\nFederal courts have also determined that sidewalk maintenance is a municipal responsibility. The ADA’s wide-reaching regulations cover every program, service, and activity provided by state and local governments. In deciding the landmark case of Barden v. Sacramento (2002), the Ninth Circuit for the US Court of Appeals determined that existing sidewalks fell under the ADA’s purview because “maintaining public sidewalks is a normal function of a city and without a doubt something that the city does.”\n\nTHE CITY’S THREE SIDEWALK REPAIR PROGRAMS\n\nThe City’s Sidewalk Repair Program is divided into three different sub-programs: access request, City facility, and rebate. The Willits settlement requires the City to maintain an access request program so that persons with a mobility disability can request sidewalk repairs, curb ramp installations, or other improvements in the pedestrian PROW. The Willits settlement also requires the City to prioritize pedestrian improvements serving City facilities.\n\nIn addition, the City Council enacted a rebate program to share the cost of sidewalk repair with participating private property owners. Access requests and rebate applications are submitted through the City’s 311 service request system. Any Angeleno can also report a sidewalk problem through 311, though these are not addressed by the access or rebate programs.\n\nThe Public Works Department (Public Works) is the lead agency for the City’s Sidewalk Repair Program. Public Works’ Bureau of Engineering (BOE) is the designated program manager and oversees all aspects of compliance with Willits and its overlap with the implementation of Fix-and-Release. The Bureau of Street Services (StreetsLA) and the Bureau of Contract Administration (BCA) also play important roles related to field assessment, construction, tree work, and inspection.\n\nIn addition to access requests and rebate applications, the Willits settlement prioritizes the pedestrian improvements in the PROW adjacent to City facilities, including the accessible route leading to each facility’s primary entrances. The Willits settlement’s goal for the City is to complete such work at City facilities within the first five years of the agreement’s compliance period, if feasible.\n\nThe City’s proprietary departments (Water & Power, Harbor, and Airports) also participate by repairing sidewalks in and around their facilities. Finally, the Department on Disability, the City Attorney’s Office, and other units in the City play key support roles for the program.\n\nThe Willits settlement requires the City to allocate at least 20% of its annual obligation towards access requests and $5 million towards curb ramps. The proprietary departments have also contributed towards the City’s annual obligation by allocating some revenues towards pedestrian improvements at their own facilities. The remaining obligation has been spent towards Council-controlled City facilities, the rebate program, and overall program administration.\n\nADA REQUIREMENTS AND ACCESSIBILITY DESIGN STANDARDS\n\nThe ADA requires the City to apply accessibility standards during new construction, the alteration of existing facilities (not maintenance), and the remediation of barriers at existing facilities. The US Access Board develops accessible design guidelines, which help to ensure that a facility’s features do not become a physical barrier to access. These guidelines become enforceable standards after they are adopted by the US Departments of Justice (USDOJ) and Transportation (USDOT), the designated federal agencies for enforcing the ADA’s requirements for state and local government and transit agencies. Current ADA standards were adopted by the federal government in 2010, and went into effect in March 2012.\n\nThe ADA requires the City to apply accessibility standards during new construction, the alteration of existing facilities (not maintenance), and the remediation of barriers at existing facilities.

Current ADA standards were adopted by the federal government in 2010, and went into effect in March 2012.\n\nIn addition, the California Building Code has accessibility standards that may go above and beyond minimum ADA requirements. For example, ADA standards require a minimum sidewalk width of 36 inches, while the California Building Code requires a minimum width of 48 inches.\n\nThe Willits settlement requires all pedestrian improvements funded under the settlement agreement to comply with whatever standards provide the most accessibility for persons with mobility disabilities. In the example above, the California Building Code’s minimum width of 48 inches would be used. The City has also adopted the ADA’s accessibility standards as its criteria for inspecting and repairing sidewalks under the Fix-and-Release policy.\n\nAs shown in Table 5, repairs for access requests, City facilities, and rebate applications generally follow the same phases, with some steps that are specific to each sub-program. Because property ownership is recorded in parcels, Public Works must evaluate the entire sidewalk within a parcel for compliance with accessibility standards to determine what needs repair in accordance with the Fix-and-Release policy.\n\nIn accordance with the Council adopted sidewalk repair prioritization system, sites are field assessed to identify non-compliant portions of sidewalk. Assessed sidewalk sites then go through design and construction to comply with accessibility and engineering standards. In addition, Urban Forestry assesses trees at all project sites to determine if and how they can be retained to allow for sidewalk repair, and performs the tree work during construction.\n\nAfter non-compliant sidewalk portions have been remediated and inspected for compliance, Public Works will issue a sidewalk certificate of compliance to the property owner. Residential property owners are given a 20-year warranty that is good for one repair by the City, while commercial and industrial property owners receive a 5-year warranty. After the warranty has elapsed, property owners will be responsible for sidewalk repair next to their property, and the City may issue a notice and order to repair if there is a non-compliant defect.\n\nAs of the end of December 2020, Public Works reports that it has spent over $122 million, repaired over 2.1 million square feet of sidewalk, constructed 1,372 curb ramps, and issued 3,693 sidewalk certificates of compliance under the Sidewalk Repair Program. Public Works has also issued 804 sidewalk certificates for other street repair projects or new developments that are required to repair sidewalks up to accessibility standards.\n\nThe following sections provide details about progress under the Sidewalk Repair Program, and makes recommendations to improve how the City can remediate and maintain more sidewalks throughout Los Angeles.\n\nFIX AND RELEASE SIDEWALK POLICY SHOULD CHANGE\n\nUsing BOE’s mapped sidewalk areas, we estimate that Los Angeles has more than 640,000 properties with adjacent sidewalks that may be subject to Fix-and-Release. More than four years after the City adopted its ordinance for the Fix-and-Release policy, Public Works has issued about 4,497 sidewalk certificates. This means that progress so far under Fix-and-Release is equivalent to less than 1% of properties with sidewalks in Los Angeles.\n\nThe City’s own policies and practices are a significant factor behind the slow pace of progress. Implementing Fix-and-Release has often meant removing and replacing the entire sidewalk at selected project sites. The difficulties of reshaping the built environment have also added time and costs.\n\nPROGRESS UNDER FIX-AND-RELEASE HAS BEEN SLOW\n\nAccess Requests\n\nAlthough the City has allocated an additional $20 million between FY 2019 and FY 2020 to accelerate repairs for access requests, Public Works still has a large backlog of pending requests that have been accumulating since the start of the Sidewalk Repair Program. Of the 3,753 access requests that the City has received through 311 up to June 2021, 2,958 have been deemed eligible and assessed, a process which takes 41 calendar days on average.\n\nConstruction takes an average of 32 days to complete once it has started. But before construction begins, all access requests must wait for available program funding, after which it then proceeds through the pre-design, design, and bid-and-award phases of the sidewalk repair process. On average, this pre-construction process takes 646 days to complete. BOE reports that it takes approximately 190 days on average to complete the process after it clears the funding queue, with the pre-design, engineering survey, design and plan production phases taking approximately 40 days.\n\nCertain factors beyond BOE’s control can slow the process. It can take months to obtain rights of entry, property owner agreements, and resolve other utility conflicts with private and public owners. Projects are also subject to the City’s contracting process. BOE handles these pre-construction phases, where more than 2,500 access requests are still pending completion. Completed access requests spent the most time (over 470 days) in queue between StreetsLA’s initial assessment and BOE’s pre-design phase to start.\n\nCity Facilities\n\nSimilar funding and resource limitations apply to sidewalks next to Council-controlled City facilities, where progress has also been slow. BOE reports that there could up to 2,700 Council-controlled City facilities that may need sidewalk repairs. From the start of the Willits compliance period in July 2017 through September 2021, the Sidewalk Repair Program has completed sidewalk repairs at only 60 of these City facilities.\n\nAlthough the City facilities that have undergone repairs include parks, senior centers, and other sites that are vital to the community, the vast majority of City facility sidewalk locations are still waiting to be addressed by BOE, which expects the work to continue throughout the 30-year Willits compliance period. To complete all Willits settlement work at all Council-controlled City facilities, BOE estimates that it may cost between $290M to $520M in construction costs alone. So far, the City has spent $16 million on sidewalk repairs for Council-controlled City facilities.\n\nBy contrast, the proprietary departments have been able to invest more funding ($18.8 million) relative to the number of facilities within their control and plan to finish construction more quickly. The Department of Water and Power’s Water Division began construction in November 2020. It reported completing sidewalk repairs at 33 out of 106 facilities as of June 2021, and estimates that all repairs will be done by Spring 2023. Water and Power’s Power Division began construction at its facilities in 2018, and anticipates completing sidewalk repairs at all 148 of its facilities by the end of 2024. Harbor has assessed 270 sites and determined that 124 sites need repair. The department will have completed 37 (30%) by June 2022.\n\nAirports has reported spending $3.4 million for sidewalk repair. However, it is not clear how much progress Airports has made because it has not addressed all public sidewalks adjacent to its facilities. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restricts the airport from spending revenues on capital or operating costs that are not directly related to the actual transportation of passengers or property.\n\nRebate\n\nFinally, the Rebate program’s lengthy and complex application process requires property owners to manage their own sidewalk repairs in order to share the cost of repair with the City. Documentation requirements, perceived low rebate offers, increased costs of repair, requirements to reconstruct the entire sidewalk in front of their property, and the need to find their own contractor and pay for the cost of the work prior to a rebate being issued, can deter many applicants from completing the rebate process. The City has only issued 538 rebate checks for the 4,451 rebate applications received as of June 2021.\n\nOn average, a successful application will take approximately 355 days from the submission of their request, to the mailing of the rebate check. According to BOE, it takes approximately 100 days for the City to process a successful application after it clears the funding waitlist. Once an application is accepted into the program from the waitlist, the time it takes for the property owner to submit ownership documentation and complete construction can add significant time to completion. In addition, approximately 50% of applicants had their applications cancelled due to either a missed deadline, withdrawal, or inactivity.\n\nTHE CITY FACES MANY SITE CHALLENGES WHEN IMPLEMENTING FIX-AND-RELEASE\n\nAccording to BOE, all project sites have unique considerations that require research, engineering, and coordination in order to comply with City requirements. For example, the Fix-and-Release policy requires Public Works to assess the entire length of sidewalks for compliance with widths, uplifts, cross slopes, and other accessibility standards, even if an access request is only for a specific sidewalk or curb ramp access barrier. The intent of the Fix-and-Release Policy is to certify the entire sidewalk at the parcel and issue a sidewalk certificate of compliance once repairs are complete.\n\nMany portions of existing sidewalk in the City are likely non-compliant with the ADA’s standards, such as for cross slopes. For many years, the City’s standard for sidewalk cross slopes was 2.5%, until 1979 when BOE adopted a cross slope standard of 2.08%. Tolerances for minor construction errors, ground settlement, seismic activity, and other factors could increase cross slopes further than the ADA standard’s 2.08% maximum.\n\nBased on a selection of 30 field assessments for access requests covering 269 property addresses, more than half had cross slope concerns; 152 properties (57%) had sidewalks with maximum cross slopes exceeding 2.1%, though only 34 of those properties had maximum cross slopes exceeding 4%.\n\nPortions of sidewalk may also be non-compliant with widths, cracks, uplifts, and other accessibility standards. As shown in Figure 8, non-compliance with any accessibility standard is enough to require a sidewalk’s removal and replacement under Fix-and-Release.\n\nDuring the first several years of the Sidewalk Repair Program, BOE would also evaluate the entire sidewalk block at the access request locations. According to BOE, doing so allowed Public Works to create an accessible route, and efficiently deploy construction forces to work on multiple locations at a time. Because many portions of sidewalk are non-compliant, Public Works would often remove and replace the entire sidewalk at these project sites, as shown in Figure 9.\n\nRemoving every non-compliant portion of sidewalk increases the cost of repair at each location and may contribute to many rebate applicants dropping out of the rebate process. Although Public Works does not keep track of actual costs and terms between rebate applicants and their own contractor, successful rebate applicants received an average rebate amount of $5,840. As we discuss later in the report, the average construction cost for access request project sites managed by the City (nearly all of which were also residentially-zoned) was $17,800 per parcel. The low rebate offer relative to the likely cost of construction may explain why 17% of applicants drop out of the rebate process after an offer has been made.\n\nCreating compliant sidewalks and curb ramps within a non-compliant built environment could also require BOE to conduct field surveys and engineering design. The precise measurements obtained from a field survey would be used during the design phase to ensure that sidewalks, curb ramps, driveways, or other features will meet accessibility requirements as well as other engineering requirements. According to BOE, the additional time invested during the design phase to create sufficiently detailed plans typically results in a more efficient construction process.\n\nBOE has also encountered other challenges that require coordination with other parties or additional resources.For example, existing utilities, trees, and private property elements, and other infrastructure elements may create conflicts with the sidewalk. Relocation of utility boxes, such as those for traffic signals, telecommunications, and street lighting, can take a substantial amount of time. In some cases, BOE may work with the property owner to get their permission and move part of the sidewalk onto their property and minimize the need for relocation work. Additionally, tree preservation policies, including adherence to removal and replacement policy, slow the process.\n\nAll of these issues faced during the sidewalk repair process add a significant amount of time and cost to a project. Construction costs for access request and City facility sidewalks have averaged $38 per square foot, and $51 per square foot after incorporating soft costs. The cost per square foot includes many other factors besides sidewalk replacement, such as mobilization, traffic control, curb and gutter, tree work, and utilities. Costs can also differ between private contractors and City construction forces, though BOE does not compare these costs.\n\nWhile an extensive pre-design and design phase may be necessary to comply with accessibility standards for an entire sidewalk path, it is neither practical nor cost-effective to respond to every access request location in this way. In the next section, we explore the Fix-and-Release policy’s requirement to apply accessibility standards for the entire parcel of sidewalk, and recommend adopting more limited criteria for the Fix-and-Release policy. If the City adopts this recommendation, BOE should reassess the sidewalk repair process so that, to the greatest extent possible, more requests can move forward without the need to go through an extensive pre-design and design process.\n\nFOR SOME SITES, THE CITY REPLACES MORE SIDEWALK THAN IS NECESSARY\n\nAlthough the pedestrian PROW falls within the ADA’s purview, its requirements apply differently for existing infrastructure. The pedestrian PROW and existing sidewalks are held to the ADA’s program access standard, which requires the City to remediate existing sidewalk barriers to ensure access when viewed in its entirety, while newly constructed sidewalks and alterations must follow accessibility design standards. Existing facilities that are altered are required to comply to the maximum extent feasible.  \n\nA consistent body of regulatory interpretations and court rulings support the view that the ADA does not require full sidewalk replacement to meet accessibility standards. For example, in the landmark case of Barden v. Sacramento, the USDOJ filed legal briefs with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court, stating that the ADA’s program access standard does not require public entities to replace their system of existing sidewalks or make each and every sidewalk compliant with ADA standards.\n\nMore recently, federal courts determined in Kirola v. San Francisco that the city was meeting the ADA’s program access standard for the pedestrian PROW. Of note is the fact that San Francisco’s sidewalk inspection guidelines only identify specific holes, cracks, and uplifts greater than ½” as a defect. Uplifts and cracks less than ½”, cross slopes greater than 2.08%, and other non-compliant features are left in place. For the US District Court and the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco’s sidewalk repair programs and their focus on these defects was sufficient.\n\nOther cities (including New York City, Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle) have also adopted sidewalk inspection criteria that are different from the ADA’s accessibility design standards. Common inspection criteria among these cities include:\n\nVertical displacement (uplifts) of ½ inch or more;\nHorizontal displacement (voids, cracks, holes, gaps) of ½” or more; and\nExcessive slopes caused by trees, or improper slopes that do not drain toward the curb.\n\nThe Willits settlement’s objective is similar to the ADA’s requirement: to provide program access for the City’s pedestrian facilities. To achieve program access, the settlement agreement sets forth a time period and expenditure level to make improvements in the pedestrian PROW. The Willits settlement generally requires the City to improve the sidewalks adjacent to facilities owned or operated by the City so that the pedestrian PROW complies with current accessibility standards. According to BOE, this ultimately requires full sidewalk replacement at City facilities in nearly all cases.\n\nFor access request work (sites that are not adjacent to a City facility), the City must, at a minimum, address every barrier specified in the request, and give priority to requests at residential locations or that are necessary to provide access to public transit. Access requests that are more than 120 days old also receive additional priority.\n\nHowever, the Willits settlement does not require the City to address every aspect of non-compliance within the parcel lines of an access request location, and gives the City discretion to determine the scope and order of pedestrian improvements, subject to certain priorities. Without the Fix-and-Release policy’s framework to ensure full compliance with accessibility standards, BOE would in many situations have more discretion to determine how much sidewalk needs repair for each access request or rebate site.\n\nFor other improvements in the pedestrian PROW, the Willits settlement lists location types in descending order of priority:\n\nCity government offices and facilities, and paths of travel leading to their primary entrances, to be prioritized for completion within the first five years if feasible;\nTransportation corridors;\nHealthcare facilities\nPlaces of public accommodation, such as commercial and business zones\nFacilities containing employers; and\nOther areas such as residential neighborhoods and underdeveloped areas.\n\nWhile the Willits settlement does not require the City to complete sidewalk repairs and other pedestrian improvements at all locations related to a higher priority (i.e., City facilities) before it can move on to working at locations with a lower priority, the Willits settlement does include a 5-year requirement for completion of City facilities (if feasible).\n\nWith regard to the types of pedestrian improvements that the City can perform, the Willits settlement prioritizes projects that remove barriers to access, which is defined as any condition that is not compliant with accessibility standards. In practice, the Willits settlement’s prioritization requirements related to removing non-compliant conditions does not provide specific guidance because so much of the infrastructure in the pedestrian PROW encountered by the City so far is non-compliant.\n\nNevertheless, the City’s interpretation of the Willits settlement and the Fix-and-Release policy is that they require the removal of all access barriers at all City facilities first, before proceeding with other priority locations with significant defects. For example, the project shown in Figure 11 is a City-owned corner parking lot that took 460 days to complete, from the day it was initially assessed on August 2018 to when construction completed on November 2019. Though it took approximately 30 days for engineering design and 65 days for construction, a significant amount of additional time was needed for property access agreements, public contracting procedures, and street trees before construction could begin.\n\nThe project included design and reconstruction for one curb ramp and its roadway transition, the curb and gutter, and the accessible route from the sidewalk to the parking lot. It also included tree removal, planting, and preservation work (with root control barriers), the relocation of eight utilities, and the removal and replacement of 2,500 square feet of sidewalk to ensure compliance with accessibility standards.\n\nHowever, as shown in Figure 12, the pedestrian improvements did not extend far beyond the property’s edges, leaving nearby sidewalk defects unaddressed because they are outside the scope of the City facility project. Although every aspect of non-compliance within the project’s scope was removed in order to meet the Willits settlement requirements for City facility sites and issue a sidewalk certificate of compliance, the poor condition of sidewalks on the adjacent parcel can still present access challenges for persons with disabilities. There remains a need for improvements beyond the limits of City facilities and access requests.\n\nTo overcome the significant task facing the City, Public Works should use its discretion to instead prioritize work on significant sidewalk obstacles first where allowed by the Willits settlement agreement, rather than all aspects of non-compliance within a parcel. The Sidewalk Repair Program’s response should be more agile, minimizing the amount of work that is needed during the sidewalk repair process so that more locations across Los Angeles can be addressed.\n\nDeciding which sidewalk repairs and other pedestrian improvements to work on would require Public Works to carefully consider what aspects and degrees of non-compliance to prioritize, and which can be left unaddressed for now. Although there are no clear guidelines from the federal government on how to prioritize which sidewalk uplifts, widths, and cross slopes to address, Public Works can look to the precedent set by Sacramento and Long Beach.\n\nSacramento’s settlement agreement for its Barden case identifies specific sidewalk access barriers to address, including:\n\nRemoving obstacles that narrow the pedestrian pathway to less than 32 inches;\nRamping or removing uplifts greater than ½”;\nRemoving excessive cross slopes, defined as (1) cross slopes greater than 3.3% that extend for a distance greater than 15 feet or that exist at locations where the running slope exceeds 5%, or (2) at other locations with cross slopes greater than 4%.\n\nIn addition, the Barden settlement agreement encourages Sacramento to address severe access barriers near a project site, and even allowed the city to address these defects in lower priority areas before it finished addressing all barriers in higher priority areas.\n\nLong Beach settled its ADA class action lawsuit in 2017 and was required to develop a self-evaluation and transition plan to address access barriers it identified in the pedestrian PROW. To prioritize its efforts, Long Beach developed the three-tiered ranking system shown in Table 6, which is based on degrees of non-compliance.\n\nLeaving certain aspects of non-compliance unaddressed for now would mean that Public Works will not be able to issue a certificate of compliance under the current Fix-and-Release framework. However, focusing on significant defects first in a manner that is still consistent with the Willits settlement has the potential to free up resources that could be used to improve overall usability at more locations throughout Los Angeles, and move the City closer to achieving program access in the pedestrian PROW.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo give the Sidewalk Repair Program more flexibility and discretion to focus on significant sidewalk defects, City Council should consider the following:\n\nInstruct BOE, with the assistance of the City Attorney’s Office, to report back on the discretion that the City can exercise to determine the scope and order of Sidewalk Repair Program projects for access requests, and other Willits settlement project priorities.\nIf the Willits settlement allows for greater discretion than currently practiced, instruct BOE to report back on new sidewalk inspection criteria that the City can use to identify and prioritize significant obstacles for removal at access request, City facility, and rebate request locations.\nIf the Willits settlement allows for greater discretion than currently practiced, instruct BOE to report back on a new prioritization system that includes City facilities as a weighted factor alongside transportation corridors, healthcare facilities, and other Willits settlement project prioritizations so that the City can prioritize significant sidewalk obstacles at non-City facilities for removal.\nRequest the City Attorney, with the assistance of BOE, propose revisions to LAMC 62.104 to reflect new inspection criteria for sidewalk assessment, if the establishment of that new criteria is appropriate and feasible.\nInstruct BOE to review the sidewalk repair process and implement methods to allow more locations to move forward with sidewalk construction while minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, the need for extensive pre-construction efforts.\nInstruct Public Works to re-evaluate the rebate program to determine why so many applicants have dropped out in the middle of the process, and report back on methods to retain more eligible applicants, such as by increasing the rebate amount relative to the amount of construction required, allowing applicants to use a pre-approved list of contractors, or having the City do the construction work for the applicant after they have paid their share of costs.\nInstruct BOE to compare and report back on sidewalk repair costs between private contractors and City construction forces.\nDEFERRED SIDEWALK MAINTENANCE NEEDS ATTENTION\n\nAfter it adopted an ordinance in 1974 to repair tree root-damaged sidewalks at no cost to adjoining property owners, the City has not consistently operated a sidewalk repair program that matched the scale of the problem. Nearly five decades of deferred maintenance has accumulated since, across more than 9,000 miles of sidewalk in Los Angeles.\n\nEven if the City changes its Fix-and-Release policy to focus on significant access barriers first, the Willits settlement expenditure requirements and the additional funding allocations intended to accelerate access request work may not be enough to address sidewalk maintenance issues. At this point, it is not clear when the Sidewalk Repair Program will be able to address other Willits settlement priority locations like transportation corridors, healthcare facilities, places of public accommodation, employers, or residential areas.\n\nThe Willits settlement focuses on the important task of updating conditions in the pedestrian PROW to meet the needs of people with mobility disabilities. This is a larger and more urgent goal than simply maintaining existing sidewalks in a usable condition. In some situations, following accessibility standards also precludes the City from using the Willits settlement expenditures to fund other methods of sidewalk maintenance. These include temporary asphalt repairs, and concrete grinding or cutting. Each of these methods may be cost-effective alternatives that minimize tripping hazards and extend the useful life of existing sidewalks.\n\nSince FY 2016, Angelenos have reported more than 53,000 sidewalk problems through the MyLA311 system, none of which have been addressed by the Sidewalk Repair Program. For the reasons above and others, the City cannot wait or rely on the Willits-focused Sidewalk Repair Program to respond to these requests.\n\nTHE CITY’S SHORT-TERM MAINTENANCE RESPONSE FOR SIDEWALK PROBLEMS NEEDS IMPROVEMENT\n\nAccording to the USDOT’s Guide for Maintaining Pedestrian Facilities, asphalt typically has a shorter life span than concrete, but has significantly lower initial costs to install. Many cities commonly use asphalt as a temporary measure to minimize sidewalk tripping hazards until a more long-term repair can be made (Figure 14). Although StreetsLA is responsible for sidewalk problems reported to 311 by the general public, it does not have a dedicated, funded asphalt repair program.\n\nDuring FY 2018 and 2019, StreetsLA inspected and closed over 12,700 service requests for reported sidewalk problems without completing an asphalt repair (Figure 15). StreetsLA managers explained that they did not have dedicated resources to perform small asphalt repairs for sidewalks and were instructed to inspect the reported issue and refer it to the Sidewalk Repair Program. However, the Sidewalk Repair Program is focused on access requests, City facilities, and rebate requests, and therefore resources have not been budgeted for the referred general sidewalk requests (“Report a Sidewalk Problem”).\n\nAccording to StreetsLA managers, staff were instructed several years ago to begin completing temporary asphalt repairs for general sidewalk requests. However, because of a lack of dedicated staff and funding, StreetsLA managers stress that their ability to perform asphalt repairs of sidewalks is dependent on the availability of overtime funds and staff willingness to work overtime. \n\nIn FY 2021, StreetsLA took an average of 41 calendar days to close 6,337 sidewalk requests with an asphalt repair. The median time to close out a request with an asphalt repair was 24 days. In addition, over 49% of those asphalt-repaired requests were completed on Saturdays and Sundays. By comparison, the StreetsLA asphalt repair program is funded with a service level goal of completing street pothole requests in three business days. StreetsLA reported that it managed to close 92% of the 19,252 street pothole requests it received in 3 business days or less in FY2021.\n\nThough permanent sidewalk repairs are ideal for sidewalk problems, temporary asphalt repairs help the City reduce tripping hazards and improve walkability. Timely asphalt repairs are also important temporary solutions until more comprehensive repair work can take place. To improve safety and minimize liability, StreetsLA and City policymakers should establish a reasonable service level goal and fund short-term repairs of uplifts, cracks, and other sidewalk hazards.\n\nThese short-term repairs should include asphalt repairs, as well as other options like concrete grinding or cutting, which many cities use as another short-term, low-cost alternative for some uplifts. For small uplifts where the underlying cause does not continue shifting the sidewalk, concrete grinding or cutting can sometimes be considered a permanent repair and extend the useful life of a sidewalk.\n\nLooking further ahead, asphalt repairs may last a few years at most, and could quickly deteriorate due to weather conditions, wear-and-tear, and underlying issues that continue shifting the sidewalk. If the City does not follow up within a reasonable timeframe with a longer-term sidewalk solution, then policymakers should also consider establishing a proactive program to periodically inspect and repair known sidewalk defect locations.\n\nTARGETED SIDEWALK REPLACEMENT FOR LONG-TERM REPAIR\n\nAmong available repair options, replacement is considered the best and longest-term solution to address tree root growth and other underlying causes of sidewalk damage. In FY 2020, the City established the Risk and Liability Mitigation Program in StreetsLA to perform street, bike lane, and sidewalk repairs at locations with known dangerous conditions associated with injury claims and lawsuit payouts. The risk and liability crews then rotate between Council districts to perform temporary and permanent asphalt and concrete repairs at selected lawsuit/claim locations and other reported locations within the vicinity.\n\nAs of FY 2021, the Risk and Liability Mitigation Program performed targeted concrete sidewalk repairs at over 170 locations. Because it is not funded through the Willits settlement and does not apply the current Fix-and-Release policy, the risk and liability program can quickly make concrete sidewalk repairs that do not require (1) design and engineering, and (2) work on the entire parcel’s sidewalk.\n\nThe StreetsLA risk and liability program is funded for 10 concrete repair staff at an annual cost of $1.4 million. To provide a more long-term fix to known sidewalk problems, policymakers should consider expanding the Risk and Liability Mitigation Program to increase its capacity to perform permanent concrete repairs.\n\nIn addition, the City should also consider implementing a proactive response to sidewalk maintenance. If the City adopts new sidewalk inspection criteria to focus on significant defects, one approach would be to proactively inspect the entire street block on the same side of the street in response to a reported sidewalk issue. Sacramento follows this approach when responding to its 311 sidewalk requests, inspecting sidewalks at the complaint location and at neighboring properties up to the entire block on the same side of the street.\n\nThe City could extend this block inspection approach to encompass regions of sidewalk at a time. In addition to its Accelerated Sidewalk Abatement Program (ASAP) that responds to 311 sidewalk requests, San Francisco’s Sidewalk Inspection and Repair Program (SIRP) proactively inspects multiple contiguous blocks at a time. SIRP was established in 2007 and has a goal of inspecting and repairing 200 blocks each year and covering the entire city within 25 years. According to San Francisco sidewalk repair staff, SIRP had inspected and repaired about 1,800 of the 5,000 street blocks in their city as of June 2021.\n\nBy implementing a proactive approach to sidewalk repair, the City of Los Angeles can (1) identify unreported sidewalk defects, (2) improve routes for pedestrians, and (3) deploy construction forces to work on many sidewalk issues at one general location, which can boost efficiency.\n\nCONDUCTING A SIDEWALK AND CURB RAMP CONDITION ASSESSMENT\n\nTo facilitate cost-effective management of sidewalk and curb ramp projects, the City should consider an asset management approach that prioritizes pedestrian facility reconstruction and maintenance activities at locations that bring the most value for Angelenos. However, the Sidewalk Repair Program’s current prioritization system does not include citywide data on sidewalk conditions and damage. Currently, the system obtains sidewalk condition data as the sites are being reviewed for prioritization. This system is incomplete because Public Works does not have data on sidewalk damage conditions.\n\nBroadly speaking, sidewalk and curb ramp repair locations can be prioritized by two groups of factors: (1) activity drivers such as pedestrian traffic volume, and proximity to community resources such as government offices, transit corridors, and medical facilities; and (2) site conditions such as damage severity, degree of non-compliance, and estimated cost.\n\nThe City’s Sidewalk Repair Program has two prioritization systems: one for access requests required by the Willits settlement, and another for City facilities and other locations. Although the prioritization system for City facility sidewalks uses some alternative criteria in lieu of pedestrian traffic volumes as a measure of activity, it does not incorporate site conditions until those locations have already been selected for field assessment through the Tier 1 factors shown in Table 7.\n\nAssessing sidewalk damage is typically a time-consuming process. Inspectors must walk the entire sidewalk length and manually measure and record different slopes and lengths. In 2012, StreetsLA estimated that a comprehensive survey covering the entire system of sidewalks and parkways in Los Angeles could cost well over $10 million and take 2-3 years to complete, an investment that was deemed too costly at the time. However, without data on sidewalk conditions, the City has not been able to prioritize repairs at locations that need it the most.\n\nWhile a sidewalk and curb ramp condition assessment is traditionally a labor-intensive process, a number of other cities have used new methods and technologies to make the process more efficient. For example, Seattle relied on a team of college engineering interns to manually assess sidewalks and curb ramps for each sidewalk block, and equipped the data collectors with tablets preconfigured with geolocation software that sped up data entry and processing. Seattle received $400,000 for its sidewalk condition assessment, which took 15 months to complete and covered all 2,336 miles of sidewalk in their city.\n\nTo conduct a self-evaluation of its pedestrian facilities as required by its ADA class action lawsuit, Long Beach contracted with an outside firm to conduct a self-evaluation of its sidewalk and curb ramp conditions. Long Beach’s contractor deployed technicians on specially-equipped Segway scooters with sensors that captured slopes, lengths, and other observations as it rode along sidewalks, largely automating the tasks of measuring and recording data. This approach provided Long Beach with detailed data that it plans to use to prioritize repairs based on the degree of noncompliance with accessibility standards.\n\nAccording to their ADA coordinator, Long Beach’s contractor was able to conduct the self-evaluation covering 1,214 sidewalk miles in one year, process the collected data, and provide a final report at a cost of about $1.5 million.\n\nWith at least 9,000 sidewalk miles in Los Angeles, the scale of a similar project for the City would be much larger. Still, the results may be worth the cost if it helps the City identify and strategically target repairs in areas that need it the most. Having an inventory of sidewalk and curb ramp conditions in Los Angeles would help the City better prioritize available funding for the types of repairs at locations that bring the most value.\n\nConducting a sidewalk condition and curb ramp assessment would also help the City comply with its ADA obligations. Although not required by the Willits settlement, the ADA does require public entities to conduct a self-evaluation to identify and create an inventory of barriers to access for its existing facilities, programs, services, and activities. Public entities then have to translate the results of its self-evaluation into a transition plan that describes how and when access barriers will be prioritized and addressed to provide program access.\n\nThe City’s outdated transition plan was last revised in September 2000 and does not include an inventory of access barriers in existing sidewalks. The Department on Disability (DoD) is currently leading the City’s new ADA self-evaluation and hopes to have an updated transition plan in three years. However, DoD currently does not plan to conduct a sidewalk or curb ramp assessment as part of the City’s new self-evaluation, due largely to a lack of funding.\n\nInstead, the City’s upcoming transition plan will only point to the number of access requests and reports of sidewalk problems as evidence of access barriers in the pedestrian PROW. In addition, the new transition plan will only reference the Willits settlement’s $1.37 billion obligation over 30 years as the City’s transition plan for the pedestrian PROW. The City’s obligations under the Willits settlement do not encompass the entirety of the City’s obligations under the ADA.\n\nWithout an actual condition assessment to know what sidewalk and curb ramp defects are in the pedestrian PROW, or a plan that identifies and connects resources to priorities, it is not clear that the City’s current sidewalk repair programs will be enough. As part of a failed ballot proposition in 1998, the City estimated that approximately 40% of the City’s sidewalks needed repair. Even if the estimated amount of sidewalk in disrepair was halved, it would cost more than $3 billion to repair 20% of the City’s 307 million square feet of sidewalk, at a cost of $51 per square foot. While this estimate far exceeds the Willits settlement’s $1.37 billion obligation, the reality is that the City does not know how many sidewalk locations need repair and how much it will cost. To identify sidewalk and curb ramp repair locations and better prioritize its remediation efforts, City policymakers should consider funding a condition assessment.\n\nOUTSIDE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SIDEWALK REPAIRS\n\nWith a significant amount of sidewalk repair still to be addressed, the City should also look at every opportunity available to accelerate its work. City departments have had some success with grant applications for federal and state funding for several projects that include sidewalk repair work. One shortcoming of many grant opportunities is that their one-time funding model makes it difficult to reliably incorporate funding into wider plans for sidewalk repair. To overcome this problem, the City should explore using the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and other reliable funding streams for sidewalk improvement.\n\nCDBG is a formula-based federal grant that is annually allocated to state and local governments. CDBG is relatively flexible and has many eligible uses, as long as the City can demonstrate that funded activities chiefly benefit low-and-moderate income persons. The City generally has about $70 to 80 million each year in CDBG funding to allocate for qualifying activities, which includes projects to remove and replace defective sidewalks.\n\nAlthough there are many competing uses, including housing assistance, senior services, and community centers, the City has used CDBG funding in the past for sidewalk repairs. In FY 2001, the Council adopted a plan to allocate $3.65 million in CDBG funds alongside $4.6 million in general funds to improve 46.5 miles of sidewalk. More recently, the City has funded several smaller projects that include sidewalk improvements, though some of these projects have yet to get started.\n\nAccording to staff from the Community Investment for Families Department, the City’s lead department for planning and administering CDBG funds, some recent projects that include sidewalk improvements have been slow to start construction and expend grant funding. As of June 2021, there were five CDBG-funded projects that include sidewalk improvements, with $12.3 million in unspent balances from the $16 million that were allocated. Funding allocations for several of these projects even date back to FY 2016.\n\nWith over 61,000 requests sent to the City’s 311 system since August 2015, there is no shortage of sidewalk problems that are waiting to be addressed. Improving sidewalks and installing curb ramps at all 3,000 pending access request locations would likely qualify for CDBG funding because they serve people with mobility disabilities. In addition, over 57% (30,270) of the 53,000 reported sidewalk problems submitted by the general public are located in low-and-moderate income census areas which may qualify for CDBG funding.\n\nEven some rebate requests may qualify for CDBG funding. Over 160 of the 500 completed rebate applications, and more than 1,700 of the 3,900 canceled, pending, or open rebate applications, are for sidewalks located in low-and-moderate income census areas. The City may be able to use CDBG funding to subsidize an even higher percentage of rebate costs in CDBG-qualifying areas, just as San Antonio, Texas has done.\n\nEven certain planning and administrative activities may qualify for CDBG or other grant funding opportunities. Fontana and Covina have used CDBG funding for their ADA self-evaluation and transition planning efforts, while the San Bernardino County Transportation Authority received a $537,000 grant from the State’s Sustainable Transportation Planning Grant to fund a portion of their sidewalk condition assessment covering 17,000 miles of sidewalk. Although it already spends the maximum amount allowed by CDBG for planning and administrative activities, the City could still consider leveraging CDBG and other funding opportunities to support a sidewalk and curb ramp assessment.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo make sidewalks safer to use, and to allow for better planning and accelerate the City’s response to reported sidewalk problems, City Council should consider the following:\n\nInstruct StreetsLA to report back on a plan to complete short-term maintenance repairs of reported sidewalk problems, both in response to 311 requests and proactively at known sidewalk defect locations going forward. The plan should include proposed service level goals, frequency of proactive inspections, and funding levels necessary to achieve those goals.\nInstruct StreetsLA, with assistance from the Bureau of Engineering, to report back on a plan to implement long-term solutions for sidewalk repair. The plan should consider how the City can respond to 311 requests for general sidewalk repair in coordination with the Willits-focused Sidewalk Repair Program, proactively address unreported sidewalk defects, and create safe and usable sidewalk paths for pedestrians. The plan should include proposed service level goals, sidewalk inspection criteria, and funding levels necessary to achieve those goals.\nInstruct the Bureau of Engineering, with the assistance of the Department on Disability, to review and report back on options for the City to conduct a sidewalk and curb ramp condition assessment, including new technologies and methods that have been used by Seattle, Long Beach, and other cities.\nInstruct the Community Investment for Families Department, and other relevant City departments, to review and report back on grant opportunities for sidewalk repair work, and how departments can use those additional funds to address 311 general sidewalk requests, curb ramp installations, and a sidewalk and curb ramp condition assessment.\nOTHER AREAS REVIEWED\n\nIn addition to the findings described in earlier sections of this report, we explored several other related areas. We present these additional findings and recommendations below.\n\nTHE CITY HAS NOT IMPLEMENTED THE $20,000 PER PARCEL CAP ON SIDEWALK REPAIR COSTS\n\nThe Council’s 2016 proposal for the Sidewalk Repair Program includes a per-parcel cap on the City’s cost to repair sidewalks. The cap’s purpose was to limit the City’s obligation (1) for excessively complicated and expensive sidewalk repairs, or (2) at very large parcels. Under this approach, the City would pay for the actual costs up to the cap, and require the property owner to pay the remaining cost. After Public Works determined that a $20,000 cap was appropriate (with annual adjustments in accordance with the Consumer Price Index) that limit was enacted by ordinance into LAMC 62.104.\n\nThe cap would not apply to the City’s own sidewalk repair costs for Council-controlled facilities, or the rebate program. It could be implemented for access requests, proprietary department sidewalk repairs, and repairs at other locations. However, while average construction costs per parcel have not exceeded the cap, Public Works has not implemented a process to estimate costs by parcel, track sidewalk repair costs on a per-parcel basis, or require property owners to pay costs above $20,000. Had Public Works implemented the cap, some property owners that had their sidewalks fixed as part of an access request could have been impacted.\n\nPublic Works has issued sidewalk certificates of compliance to 2,694 parcels under the access request program. Since the start of the Willits compliance period through the end of December 2020, Public Works has spent $48 million on construction, and $64 million in total after including associated soft costs. The average cost per parcel for access requests is $17,800 for construction and $23,900 after including soft costs. The cap’s actual impact would differ at each parcel depending on the scope of the project and costs that could be attributed to the parcel.\n\nIf the Council and Public Works adopt this report’s earlier recommendations to change the Fix-and-Release criteria to focus on significant defects, City policymakers should also consider revising or eliminating the cost cap.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n12. Policymakers should re-evaluate the ordinance revising the cap to reflect what the City has learned about the costs of sidewalk repair under the Fix-and-Release framework, and consider instructing Public Works to track and enforce the cap, or eliminate the cost cap all together.\n\nPROACTIVE REPEAT ROOT CUTTING IS UNTESTED AS A LONG-TERM SOLUTION\n\nPoor tree selection decades ago has led to widespread conflicts between trees and sidewalks throughout the City. Public Works faces difficult choices at each juncture between sidewalks and trees, with the need to balance the desire to maintain and grow the urban canopy while also allowing for sidewalk repair work to move forward. Within this environment, the StreetsLA Urban Forestry Division (UFD) makes recommendations about whether to retain or remove a tree based on a combination of individual site assessments, and the knowledge and professional experience of staff. More often than not, UFD uses root pruning and root cutting to retain trees.\n\nAvailable data from the Sidewalk Repair Program shows that, as of June 2021, UFD removed approximately 800 trees and planted 1,530 trees as part of Public Works’ 2-to-1 tree replacement policy, and has used root pruning/cutting on over 2,900 trees. To cut tree roots, UFD may use a stump grinder or root cutting machine in some situations to sever enough roots on one side of the tree to allow for construction. However, UFD’s past experience shows that roots may grow back in as little as three to five years and cause new cracks and uplifts.\n\nTo resolve root cutting’s temporary nature, StreetsLA proposed and implemented a proactive root cutting program to cut roots again at select sites on a three-to-five-year cycle. To do so, UFD may use a root cutting machine in some situations to create a path up to 14” deep in order to cut new roots that may have grown before they can cause any new sidewalk issues. UFD staff continue to monitor those trees. However, arboricultural literature consistently highlights the general risks of root cutting to the tree’s health and stability.\n\nEven if a tree can handle it, the stress of root cutting can make a tree more susceptible to pests and disease or trigger a negative response that may shorten its lifespan, and therefore could create the need for removal. The short‐term and long‐term effects can vary depending on the site conditions and the level of impact to the roots of the tree.\n\nIf roots must be severed at all, root management practices generally recommend selective root pruning. Root pruning requires a careful and labor-intensive process of excavating soil to expose roots for a thorough assessment to determine which roots can be cut and the best places to cut.\n\nUFD acknowledges that it is not aware of any research on the effects of repeated root cutting over a long period of time. Despite the uncertainties, UFD has moved forward with its proactive root cutting program and continues to monitor the tree’s health during post inspections. Given the arboricultural industry’s general consensus on the risks of root cutting, UFD’s repeat root cutting protocol calls for added caution.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n13.  Policymakers should consider obtaining an independent opinion from a registered arborist consultant regarding UFD’s root cutting practices, and obtain independent technical advice on how to sustainably manage tree and sidewalk conflicts.\n\nSLAG MAY BE A SUSTAINABLE CEMENT ALTERNATIVE THAT ALSO REDUCES URBAN HEAT\n\nAs part of the Sidewalk Repair Program, the Council instructed BOE to report on alternative materials that can be used for sidewalk repair, which is usually constructed with concrete made from a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, and rocks. In its March 2020 report back, BOE recommended removing the rubber materials and pavers that were tested because of its poor performance, while recommending continued monitoring for cementitious pavers and slag concrete materials. The City should give slag further consideration for its potential environmental benefits.\n\nUsing slag cement is one strategy, among many, recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which could help mitigate the urban heat island effect. According to the EPA’s Cool Pavements reports, conventional pavements like asphalt and concrete can reach peak summertime surface temperatures of 120-150°F. The sun’s heat is then transferred into the pavement’s sub-surface and re-released at night, increasing temperatures and contributing to the urban heat island effect. The increased temperatures create additional cascading effects, such as increased air conditioning use, summertime peak energy demands, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSlag holds two key environmental benefits over Portland cement. First, slag is an industrial by-product that is recovered from iron ore processing and can be reused to partially replace Portland cement for concrete applications, while producing Portland cement requires high temperatures exceeding 2500°F, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Second, slag’s lighter color, when compared to Portland cement, increases the finished product’s solar reflectivity, leading to reduced heat absorption and lower urban temperatures. One study cited in the EPA’s report measured solar reflectance of 60% from slag concrete compared to 35% for a conventional concrete mix.\n\nDuring its limited monitoring period, BOE found that slag performed similarly to Portland cement concrete and was just as cost-effective. Other studies found that slag cement can have similar or greater strength than Portland cement. Some state and local governments have even incorporated the use of slag cement in their standards, or as part of the concrete mixture for airport runways, bridges, highways, and other public works projects.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n14.  If BOE’s continued monitoring demonstrates sufficient strength, durability, workability, compliance with disabled access standards, cost-effectiveness, and other desirable characteristics, the City should consider using slag as a partial replacement or substitute for Portland cement in order to mitigate the urban heat island effect and the negative environmental impact of concrete used for sidewalk repairs.\n\nFIX-AND-RELEASE DOES NOT CHANGE THE CITY’S LIABILITY FOR SIDEWALK INJURIES\n\nAs discussed in the background, the State’s sidewalk maintenance law gives local governments a way to impose sidewalk repair responsibilities onto property owners. However, local governments are still primarily responsible for sidewalk maintenance and are generally liable for sidewalk injuries.\n\nStreet and Highway Code sections 5600 through 5630 describe a code enforcement framework that:\n\nImposes a duty onto abutting property owners to repair sidewalks;\nRequires local governments to issue notices ordering property owners to repair sidewalks up to a safe and usable condition;\nRequires local governments to repair sidewalks that are not completed by notified property owners in a timely manner; and\nAllows local governments to assess the cost of repair as a lien on the property.\n\nLocal governments that choose to adopt the State’s sidewalk maintenance law or enact similar ordinances do not transfer their primary duty of sidewalk repair onto property owners. They only create a repair responsibility for property owners. In the landmark case of Schaefer v. Lenahan (1944), the California Court of Appeals concluded that the property owner’s duty to repair sidewalks is only owed to their local government because the State law’s purpose was to provide local governments a way to transfer or recover the cost of sidewalk repair.\n\nFurther, unless there is legislative language that explicitly creates an additional responsibility to the public, the Court determined that property owners do not owe a general duty of care to pedestrians who may become injured by sidewalk defects. The City’s Fix-and-Release policy, as enacted in LAMC 62.104, only imposes a duty of repair onto property owners after the City has issued a sidewalk certificate of compliance and the repair warranty period has elapsed. LAMC 62.104 does not impose any new liabilities onto property owners that is owed to pedestrians injured by sidewalk defects adjacent to their property.\n\nIn general, the only way for local governments to share liability for sidewalk injuries is to adopt “clear and unambiguous” legislative language doing so. San Jose enacted an ordinance to explicitly place liability onto property owners, which was confirmed by the courts in 2004 as allowable under State law and the California Constitution. Since then, many cities in and around the Bay Area (including San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, and Sacramento) have adopted similar ordinances.\n\nIf the City follows through with enforcing the property owner’s repair responsibility after the sidewalk certification’s warranty has ended, modifying LAMC 62.104 so that property owners share liability would simultaneously mitigate the City’s risks and incentivize property owners to make sidewalk repairs. At the same time, sharing injury liability would come with its own challenges and potentially create unfair liabilities for some property owners.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n15.  If the City moves forward with imposing sidewalk repair responsibilities onto property owners, policymakers should consider whether the Municipal Code should be revised so that sidewalk injury liability is shared with property owners.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nNumber\tRecommendation\nResponsible Entity: City Council\n1\tInstruct BOE, with the assistance of the City Attorney’s Office, to report back on the discretion that the City can exercise to determine the scope and order of Sidewalk Repair Program projects for access requests, and other Willits settlement project priorities.\n2\tIf the Willits settlement allows for greater discretion than currently practiced, instruct BOE to report back on new sidewalk inspection criteria that the City can use to identify and prioritize significant obstacles for removal at access request, City facility, and rebate request locations.\n3\tIf the Willits settlement allows for greater discretion than currently practiced, instruct BOE to report back on a new prioritization system that includes City facilities as a weighted factor alongside transportation corridors, health care facilities, and other Willits settlement project prioritizations so that the City can prioritize significant sidewalk obstacles at non-City facilities for removal.\n4\tRequest the City Attorney, with the assistance of BOE, propose revisions to LAMC 62.104 to reflect a new inspection criteria for sidewalk assessment, if the establishment of that new criteria is appropriate and feasible.\n5\tInstruct BOE to review the sidewalk repair process and implement methods to allow more locations to move forward with sidewalk construction while minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, the need for extensive pre-construction efforts.\n6\tInstruct Public Works to re-evaluate the rebate program to determine why so many applicants have dropped out in the middle of the process, and report back on methods to retain more eligible applicants, such as by increasing the rebate amount relative to amount of construction required, allowing applicants to use a pre-approved list of contractors, or having the City do the construction work for the applicant after they have paid their share of costs.\n7\tInstruct BOE to compare and report back on sidewalk repair costs between private contractors and City construction forces.\n8\tInstruct StreetsLA to report back on a plan to complete short-term maintenance repairs of reported sidewalk problems, both in response to 311 requests and proactively at known sidewalk defect locations going forward. The plan should include proposed service level goals, frequency of proactive inspections, and funding levels necessary to achieve those goals.\n9\tInstruct StreetsLA, with assistance from the Bureau of Engineering, to report back on a plan to implement long-term solutions for sidewalk repair.

The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) — our City’s first responders — was tasked with setting up large testing centers in various locations, including Dodger Stadium and Hansen Dam Recreation Center, to aid local residents. Leading the charge within LAFD was the Department’s newly organized ad hoc testing branch, which included a number of sworn staff members to aid testing operations and logistics. In many cases, staff received these assignments in addition to their regularly assigned shifts, necessitating the use of overtime at testing sites.\n\nThe immense challenges posed by responding to this novel public health crisis were not just operational or logistical, but included the implementation of administrative protocols, such as timekeeping. Last fall, the Controller’s Office received allegations that certain sworn members of LAFD assigned to pandemic testing sites were receiving excessive salaries by reporting overtime that was unwarranted or unworked. \n\nMy office interviewed LAFD employees, analyzed department timekeeping and overtime policies, and performed a targeted review of payroll records to investigate the allegations. We found that the LAFD did not have adequate timekeeping processes in place at testing sites or for pandemic response activities in general, along with several individual payroll errors.\n\nLAFD overtime\n\nLong before the pandemic began, LAFD employees incurred significant overtime pay. This happened for a variety of reasons, including department requirements for constant (24-hour) staffing at fire stations and emergency operations, like wildfire and natural disaster response. There is currently no limit on the amount of overtime that can be worked in a pay period, as long as that work is performed outside of a regularly scheduled shift.\n\nAccording to payroll data from my office, total overtime pay for Firefighters and Fire Captains covered by collective bargaining agreements totaled a record $227 million in 2020. Chief Officers also saw significant increases in paid overtime last year, up 38% over 2019 to an average of $94,700 per person. While overtime attributable to COVID-19 response activities comprised a relatively small percentage of LAFD’s yearly total — around $14 million from March through December 2020 — 1,801 sworn staff earned overtime in this manner, with 129 employees collecting more than $25,000 each in overtime for COVID-19 response. \n\nIn our investigation, my office found several clear problems with the way LAFD tracked overtime earned at testing sites. There were no formal timekeeping processes used at testing sites — no time clocks or a documented roll call — making it impossible to determine whether sworn staff assigned to the sites worked the full number of hours reported for each assigned shift. Without a systemic process that verifies the hours worked during emergency assignments, the risk for salary overpayments is high. \n\nOur review of payroll records also found irregular entries. In some instances, salaries were overpaid because overtime was duplicative of time worked during regularly assigned shifts. LAFD management did not recognize these errors before approving the erroneous timesheets, showing a need for more consistent oversight from department leadership. In addition, the department’s method for tracking labor costs related to pandemic response activities was fragmented and supported by data from multiple systems and manually generated forms. \n\nEffective systems needed\n\nTo prevent overtime payment errors and ensure readiness for future emergencies, the LAFD must implement more effective timekeeping and oversight systems by doing the following:\n\nRevise timekeeping practices for all non-regular work hours to require sworn staff to formally check in and out with real-time location information for each shift.\nEstablish an internal oversight process that identifies and validates overtime by sworn staff prior to processing payroll and reviews the overtime of high earners.\nAnalyze all pandemic response payroll data to identify errors and then seek reimbursement for any overtime payments made to sworn staff who inappropriately reported working overtime during a regular shift.\nStreamline automated timekeeping and payroll practices to ensure more accurate labor cost reporting.\n\nI urge the LAFD to act swiftly on these recommendations to improve operations and accountability in the City’s emergency response activities.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCOVID-19 brought incredible tragedy and disruption to people everywhere. Seemingly overnight, nearly every facet of our lives was transformed and Angelenos faced uncertainty about how to stay safe and contain the spread of the virus. During the early stages of the pandemic, City officials faced critical decisions about how to continue providing residents with essential government services, while also adjusting to situational needs as a result of the unfolding public health emergency.\n\nAs they often are, personnel from the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) were deployed to help protect our residents. Initially, sworn staff assigned to functions that were temporarily suspended due to the citywide stay-at-home order were reassigned to the ad hoc Testing Branch. In addition, sworn staff from throughout the Fire Department were deployed to various pandemic response efforts including test site operations, ground support, and logistics.\n\nCOVID-19 test sites were opened across City at locations such as Dodger Stadium, Hansen Dam Recreation Center, Lincoln Park, and Pierce College. By the end of February 2021, nearly four million tests were administered. The work at the test sites, as well as the continued 24/7 emergency services by LAFD was not without risk—550 sworn members tested positive for COVID-19 from Thanksgiving 2020 through January 2020 alone. Sadly, two members of the Los Angeles Fire Department passed away from complications arising from COVID-19.\n\nEmergency response—in any form—is typically challenging due to the urgency of the situation and risks faced by first responders and members of the public. As a result, administrative protocols, such as timekeeping, are severely tested or altogether overlooked. But the need for effective controls is especially important during these situations because personnel are often working overtime and receiving extra pay. This arrangement raises larger questions about how other City departments, resources, or personnel activated through the City’s Disaster Service Worker program could be deployed to effectively carry out similar responsibilities during future emergencies.\n\nIn September 2020, the Controller’s Office received allegations that sworn members of LAFD assigned to pandemic testing sites were receiving excessive salaries due to their reporting of overtime that was unwarranted or unworked. We performed audit analysis and targeted test work to determine the validity of the allegations.\n\nWhat We Found\nThere was no contemporaneous process or system used for timekeeping (such as check in and check out time logs) at pandemic test sites, therefore we can neither confirm, nor dispute, that sworn staff actually worked the full number of hours reported for each assigned shift.\nWe tested a limited sample of reported time and found that, in some instances, salaries were overpaid because overtime hours reported by sworn staff were duplicative of time worked during regularly assigned shifts. These errors were not recognized by department management prior to timesheet approval, and were subsequently processed as valid work time within the payroll system.\nLAFD’s method for tracking and accumulating labor costs for the pandemic response is fragmented and labor intensive. The current process increases the likelihood that duplicate payments or other anomalies go undetected.\nWhat We Recommend\nRevise timekeeping practices for all non-regular work hours to require all sworn staff to formally check in and check out on-site for each shift. Related records should be easily accessible by department management and payroll staff, and should be automated to the extent possible using available technologies (i.e. cellular/radio and GPS).\nAnalyze sworn staff payroll data to identify, correct, and seek reimbursement for any overtime payments made to sworn staff who inappropriately reported working overtime during a regular work shift.\nTo improve the methods used to track and accumulate emergency response costs, LAFD should utilize functionalities of current and planned automated timekeeping systems, such as activity-specific work orders, tasks, and subtasks for employee time reporting. These actions would provide for more comprehensive reporting of labor costs for monitoring and reimbursement purposes, and would leverage existing tools to support key management functions such as resource planning, budgeting, and cost control.\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn March 2020, the Mayor tasked the Fire Department with overseeing City-run pandemic testing sites. These deployments were developed by the Testing Branch Director and authorized by the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) through the department’s Daily Management Plans (DMP). Using resource levels established within DMPs, the Testing Branch identified and assigned sworn staff on a voluntary basis to perform duties supporting the City’s pandemic test site operations. In many cases, these shifts were assigned to sworn staff in addition to their regular station assignments, which necessitated the use of overtime to satisfy authorized resource requirements.\n\nIn September 2020, the Controller’s Office received allegations that sworn members of the Fire Department assigned to pandemic testing sites were receiving excessive salaries due to their reporting of overtime that was unwarranted or unworked. Beyond these allegations at pandemic testing sites, the following subsections provide a primer on how sworn staff are deployed and overtime pay is incurred.\n\nDeployment of Sworn Staff and Overtime Pay\n\nRegardless of the type of assignment, all sworn staff at the Fire Department are required to work their regular assigned work shifts unless an exception is reported, such as training, sick-time, or vacation.\n\nPlatoon duty assignments facilitate the Fire Department’s policy to maintain “constant staffing” at each fire station by assigning sworn staff to one of three platoon schedules that operate on a 24-hour shift pattern and rotate on a 9-day schedule. The scheduling framework is designed to provide coverage flexibility through the use of overtime during periods of planned and unplanned absences. This has traditionally provided the Fire Department with the capability to respond to all fire and emergency medical service calls within the City by leveraging overtime capacity when any type of staff absence occurs.\nSworn staff assigned to administrative or non-station duties work four 10-hour days per week. These staff can work overtime hours before and after their regular daily shifts, or for entire shifts during their regular days off.\n\nFor both platoon-duty and administrative assignments there is no limit on the amount of overtime hours that can be worked, as long as it is performed outside of a regularly scheduled shift.\n\nOvertime pay rates and requirements for sworn staff are negotiated through collective bargaining agreements and subject to a host of complex labor laws, regulations, and departmental policy. In general, sworn staff on administrative schedules begin to accrue overtime once 40 hours or more have been worked within a week. Sworn staff working platoon duty assignments accrue overtime for hours worked in addition to their regularly scheduled 24-hour work shifts, but must work a predetermined number of hours in each monthly period for any additional work hours to qualify for overtime pay. In most cases, overtime pay is calculated on an hourly basis using one and a half times an individual’s hourly pay rate, and can significantly increase individual sworn staff salaries.\n\nOvertime pay rates and requirements for sworn staff are negotiated through collective bargaining agreements and subject to a host of complex labor laws, regulations, and departmental policy.

In most cases, overtime pay is calculated on an hourly basis using one and a half times an individual’s hourly pay rate, and can significantly increase individual sworn staff salaries.\n\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fire Department has traditionally incurred significant amounts of overtime costs for several reasons, including department requirements for constant (24-hour) staffing at fire stations throughout the City and emergency operations such as wildfire and natural disaster response.\n\nAccording to City payroll data, total overtime pay for sworn staff covered by collective bargaining agreements for Firefighters and Fire Captains totaled a record $227 million during 2020; averaging $65,800 per full-time Firefighter or Fire Captain. This represents a 13% increase from the overtime paid in 2019, and a 67% total increase in annual overtime paid since 2013. The Fire Department has cited additional factors such as salary rate increases and restored positions for the increasing trend in overtime pay, but it remains clear that the department consistently relies upon the significant use of overtime to satisfy operational needs.\n\nSource:  Control Panel L.A. Payroll Explorer (http://lacity.payroll.finance.socrata.com)\n\nAdditionally, sworn staff covered by collective bargaining agreements for Fire Chief Officers (Battalion, Assistant, and Deputy Chiefs) can also receive overtime compensation when they are assigned to special duty assignments. Total overtime pay for Fire Chief Officers reached a record high of $9.2 million in 2020; averaging $94,700 per Fire Chief Officer. This represents a 38% increase from the overtime paid in 2019, and an 91% total increase in annual overtime paid to Fire Chiefs since 2013.\n\nSource:  Control Panel L.A. Payroll Explorer (http://lacity.payroll.finance.socrata.com)\n\nSCOPE\n\nWe performed the following procedures to assess the allegations submitted to our Office and evaluate the Fire Department’s staffing and timekeeping practices related to COVID-19 testing sites:\n\nAnalyzed City payroll records to quantify and understand salary payments made to LAFD sworn staff related to the City’s pandemic response.\nInterviewed LAFD management including the Assistant Fire Chiefs in charge of the department’s pandemic response and Emergency Operations Center, the head Fire Administrator, and the Testing Branch Director to ascertain how pandemic test sites were organized, staffed, and operated.\nPerformed process walkthroughs with Fire Department Accounting and Payroll Managers and staff to understand payroll and cost accounting practices related to pandemic response activities.\nInterviewed the Fire Department’s Employee Relations Officer and a senior Battalion Chief to gain an understanding of department timekeeping policies, practices, and documentation used by sworn staff for emergency response activities.\nReviewed overtime policies, practices, and documentation related to sworn staff assigned to test site operations.\nAssessed department timekeeping practices for sworn staff assigned to support test site operations.\nSelected a sample of days that test sites were operating and traced a sample of related payments to supporting documents.\nFINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Timekeeping processes used for COVID response activities were focused on shift completion rather than specific hours worked\n\nShortly after the onset of the COVID-19 public health emergency, the Fire Department established an ad hoc Testing Branch to oversee the City’s pandemic testing efforts. Sworn staff from the Fire Department were deployed to support various pandemic efforts including test site operations, ground support, and logistics. Many of these shifts were assigned to sworn staff in addition to their regular work assignments, which necessitated the use of overtime to meet the Department’s authorized resource requirements.\n\nSworn staff assigned to support Test Site Operations reported to Test Site Managers or other functional unit leaders (e.g. Ground Support or Logistics Leaders), and were considered to be “on-duty” from the beginning to the end of their daily shift. During the establishment of pandemic test sites, it was typical for sworn staff to work 12- to 16-hour shifts depending on the sites’ operations and related functional needs. \n\nHowever, there were no formal timekeeping processes used at testing sites such as time-clocks or a documented roll call. Since sworn staff were considered to be “on-duty” during the entirety of their assigned shifts, there are no provisions for mandated breaks. This is typical for sworn staff, and reflective of the Fire Department’s expectations for sworn staff who work regular 24-hour platoon duty assignments.\n\nSpecial work assignments performed in addition to regular duty assignments are reported by sworn staff to their respective Station Captain or Supervisor, rather than to Test Site Managers, for entry into the official timekeeping system used to process payroll. At the end of each week, sworn staff are also required to report all of their worktime related to special emergency activities on an Emergency Activity Report (Form-101). Sworn staff use information contained within the Fire Department’s Scheduling System to populate their Form-101 and submit it for approval by their respective Test Site Manager or designated unit leader. Approved Form-101s are then forwarded to the Fire Department’s Accounting Division for cost reporting and recordkeeping purposes.\n\nSince there was no contemporaneous process or system used for timekeeping at COVID-19 test sites, we can neither confirm, nor dispute, that sworn staff actually worked the full number of hours reported for each assigned shift. Even though a large percentage of sworn staff who earned significant amounts overtime pay, there is no way to validate that staff were physically present during the entirety of each overtime shift. This issue applies to COVID-19 testing sites which were the primary focus of this report, and other special assignments that emerged throughout 2020.\n\nIn 2020, at least 300 Firefighters and Fire Captains more than doubled their regular salary through overtime pay, with seven employees more than tripling their regular salary. Of the 3,451 Firefighters and Fire Captains who received a salary from the City in 2020, the top 3% of overtime pay earners (100 employees) received 10% ($22.6 million) of the aggregate overtime paid during the year. Below is a histogram showing the ranges of overtime pay earned by Firefighters and Fire Captains in 2020:\n\nSource:  Control Panel L.A. Payroll Explorer (http://lacity.payroll.finance.socrata.com)\n\nIn 2020, more than 700 Firefighters and Fire Captains earned over $100,000 in overtime pay. Of the 1,801 sworn staff who reported overtime to pandemic response activities during 2020, 129 (7%) earned more than $25,000 in overtime related to pandemic response activities alone.\n\nWithout a systemic process that contemporaneously verifies the hours actually worked by sworn staff for special emergency-related assignments, LAFD is at risk for salary overpayments due to timecard errors or members recording more hours than actually worked. Therefore, additional monitoring of overtime would support management oversight and help ensure the accuracy and equity of department overtime policy.\n\nRecommendation 1\n\nTo provide assurance that all hours reported as worked by sworn staff are valid and accurate, the Fire Department should revise timekeeping practices for all non-regular work hours to require all sworn staff to formally check in and check out with real-time location information for each shift. Related records should be easily accessible by department management and payroll staff, and should be automated to the extent possible using available technologies (i.e. cellular/radio and GPS).\n\nRecommendation 2\n\nTo enhance management oversight over sworn staff overtime, the Fire Department should establish controls and processes that identify and validate all overtime reported by sworn staff prior to payroll processing. Periodic reports for sworn staff who exceed a predetermined overtime threshold (i.e. collective pay amounts and/or reported hours) should be consistently generated and reviewed by Fire Department Management to determine appropriateness of assignments and need for additional rotations, equity, and training.\n\n2. Complexities of LAFD’s non-integrated payroll processes and systems increase risk of overpayment, through inaccurate or duplicative entries\n\nOvertime for sworn staff is paid on an hourly basis per the terms of negotiated labor agreements; in most cases, overtime is paid at one and a half times the employee’s hourly pay rate. Per department policy, sworn staff are required to report each overtime shift directly to their supervisor or respective Station Captain for notation into Divisional/Station Staffing Logs, which are subsequently referenced to support a weekly timesheet approval. For all overtime related to pandemic response activities, staff were instructed to use the pandemic response work order when recording the related overtime worked into the payroll system.\n\nAn analysis of payroll data for the pandemic response work order shows that from March 2020 through December 2020, 1,801 sworn staff were paid for 248,087 hours of overtime coded specifically to the pandemic response work order. These hours resulted in corresponding overtime payments of $14.4 million.\n\nFurther analysis of the pandemic response work order reveals that the top 50 salary earners who reported overtime to this work order accounted for $5 million (34%) of the related overtime payments during the first nine months of the pandemic. For this cohort, pandemic-related overtime payments totaled between $54,000 to $202,000 during the period, which is in addition to all other pay earned by these employees (i.e. regular salary, non-pandemic response related overtime, and other bonuses and benefits). With an annual salary range of an experienced Firefighter for the City of Los Angeles at approximately $100,000 to $125,000, these amounts represent a significant increase in total compensation. Therefore, it is critical for the Fire Department to ensure that each hour of overtime reported into the City’s Payroll System is non-duplicative and reasonable.\n\nIn general, staff assigned to support pandemic test sites reported working between 12-16 hours per shift. Fire Department Management allowed sworn staff to report more hours worked than the test site operating hours because additional duties were required outside of the site’s public operating hours. According to activity logs from daily test site operations these functions included site preparation and closing duties, management of public health and safety issues, stakeholder coordination and reporting, and logistics coordination for medical supplies, personal protective equipment, and test kits.\n\nDuring our review of timekeeping for staff who worked overtime in support of pandemic test sites, we found some inconsistencies within the supporting documents. We performed a targeted review of time records and related data for a sample of sworn staff assigned to support test site operations on two days during the second quarter of 2020. While reviewing pertinent records, we noted some irregular time entries which warranted further review. Our review revealed that, in some instances, salaries were overpaid because overtime reported by sworn staff were duplicative of time worked during regularly assigned shifts.\n\nEven though Fire Department Management was able to justify most instances where we identified potential errors, Fire Department Management agreed that some overpayments had occurred because sworn staff incorrectly reported overtime hours on their timesheets during regularly scheduled work shifts, which is a violation of department timekeeping policy (i.e., claiming overtime hours that were duplicative of regularly assigned shifts). These errors were not recognized by department management prior to timesheet approval, and were subsequently processed as valid work time within the payroll system.\n\nDue to the targeted scope of our analysis—which was primarily focused on overtime at COVID-19 testing sites—it is not clear how widespread this issue is across the Fire Department. But the control weaknesses we identified combined with the significant amount of overtime payments warrants ongoing and consistent oversight.\n\nRecommendation 3\n\nTo ensure that overtime reported by sworn staff for pandemic response activities is appropriate, the Fire Department should analyze payroll data to identify and seek appropriate reimbursement for any overtime payments made to sworn staff who inappropriately reported working overtime during a regular work shift. This should also be applied to all types of overtime activities reported by sworn staff.\n\nIf inappropriate overtime payments are found to be pervasive, the department should establish controls to identify and correct erroneous time reporting, and consider providing additional training and/or take appropriate disciplinary action for sworn staff who have consistently reported erroneous overtime during their regularly scheduled work shifts.\n\nRecommendation 4\n\nTo better address a strategic goal of the department to capitalize on advanced technologies (https://www.lafd.org/about/about-lafd/strategic-plan), and to promote accountability over department payroll, the Fire Department should strengthen its urgency to consolidate and streamline its automated timekeeping and payroll practices, taking full advantage of the City’s new human resources and payroll system (HRP) that is currently being implemented citywide.\n\n3. LAFD’s method for tracking and accumulating labor costs for pandemic response is fragmented and inefficient\n\nRecording and maintaining accurate timekeeping records are critical to ensure labor costs are supported and paid in accordance with applicable requirements. During our review of sworn staff timekeeping practices and related documentation, we found that the Fire Department’s method for tracking labor costs related to pandemic response activities is fragmented and supported by data from multiple systems and manually-generated forms. Considering the significant cost to support emergency response activities, an integrated and comprehensive process is critical to ensure accuracy and would help to streamline fiscal reporting processes.\n\nThe Fire Department’s current cost accounting process for emergency response activities requires using data from many disparate sources including incident management plans, payroll system data, information from the Fire Department’s scheduling system, manually generated station work logs, employee-specific time logs, and other emergency deployment forms required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nFire Department management uses a combination of information from each of these sources to tabulate reported work hours and related costs incurred for the City’s pandemic response, as required for submitting reimbursement claims. This process for reporting emergency response costs is burdensome, as it requires a manual compilation of payroll data and other paper-based reports. Such efforts could be refined through enhancement of timekeeping and cost reporting systems.\n\nDuring our review period, the Fire Department used one specific work order code to track overtime related to pandemic response activities within the payroll system. Regular (non-overtime) work time by sworn staff is pre-programmed into the City’s payroll system under the employees’ regularly assigned fire station or division code; hours are not coded to a specific pandemic response (or any other) work order.  Since only overtime under the broad function of “pandemic response” was coded into the payroll system, the aggregate salary costs related to all pandemic response activities, which include test site operations, cannot be tabulated using payroll data alone.\n\nOther than the pandemic response workorder that was used only for overtime, no further delineation was made within the payroll system to track efforts incurred for specific activities such as test site operations, mobile testing, ground support, planning, and logistics. Such further distinctions, which could be facilitated through additional coding within the City’s payroll system, would support activity-based costing. This could provide management with valuable data on staffing resources and related costs to better manage any type of emergency incident or routine function. Further enhancements to the Fire Department’s payroll/ timekeeping system, and a process that allows it to capture detail for time worked on all program activities performed by all staff, would also provide the City with important information to support budget allocations and outcome-based performance management.\n\nRecommendation 5\n\nTo improve the methods used to track and accumulate emergency response costs, the Fire Department should utilize functionalities of current and planned automated timekeeping systems, such as activity-specific work orders, tasks, and subtasks for employee time reporting.  These actions would provide for more comprehensive reporting of labor costs for monitoring and reimbursement purposes, and would leverage existing tools to support key management functions such as resource planning, budgeting, and cost control.\n\nRECOMMENDATION TABLE\nNumber\tRecommendation\nResponsible Entity: Fire Department\n1\tTo provide assurance that all hours reported as worked by sworn staff are valid and accurate, the Fire Department should revise timekeeping practices for all non-regular work hours to require all sworn staff to formally check in and check out with real-time location information for each shift.

This is especially important when it comes to programs that employ surveillance technologies and collect personal data, as they represent serious privacy risks if managed improperly. \n\nThe City is currently developing policies and plans to help guide how departments modernize their information services, and how smart technologies are deployed — including the SmartLA 2028 Plan, the Digital Bill of Rights, the Code of Ethics and more. However, at this time, no single City entity is responsible for evaluating the privacy implications created by using surveillance technologies, which often have the ability to analyze the movements, behavior or actions of identifiable individuals. My latest report analyzes the City’s privacy-related efforts and recommends a new framework for evaluating and mitigating risks, which will help the City protect residents as it develops new technologies and modernizes services. \n\nA decentralized approach\n\nAs it stands, managing information and privacy is typically left to each City department. They must individually determine whether specific technologies or applications are necessary and how these tools will be used to meet their operational needs. My office found that City departments have taken many different approaches to address privacy risks associated with surveillance tools — an ad hoc method that creates inconsistencies and accountability gaps.\n\nAdditionally, the City does not currently define or inventory the surveillance technologies it uses, nor does it designate a responsible body for overseeing departments’ use of these tools. While there are some existing data management and security measures in place to ensure that the City’s information systems and sensitive records are protected, still lacking is a formal privacy management program that sets specific guidelines for addressing risks associated with the use of surveillance technologies.\n\nImplementing best practices\n\nTo ensure the City is adequately protecting the public’s privacy, more safeguards are needed and should be consistent with those established by the federal government, the State of California and other local jurisdictions. My report recommends that City policymakers should:\n\nClearly define surveillance technology and identify what is used by departments.\nDevelop a standardized surveillance impact assessment and reporting process.\nEstablish a privacy advisory board to support departments’ development of privacy policies and controls.\nRequire departments to update surveillance impact assessments on an ongoing basis.\n\nAs Controller, my goal is to make Los Angeles the smartest, most transparent City in the world. To achieve this, we need to stay up to date with emerging technologies, but at the same time, keep the safety, needs and privacy of Angelenos at the forefront of our work. I urge City leaders to adopt a framework that allows us to evolve and innovate as a City and engender greater public trust in our government.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nTechnology can help governments become more innovative, safer, and even more environmentally friendly. Increasingly, interconnected technologies and systems are facilitating the emergence of “smart cities,” which are cities that use technology to collect data, manage assets, increase efficiency, and improve livability and quality of life.    \n\nWhile new technologies present tremendous opportunities to improve the delivery of government services, it is important for the City of Los Angeles to consider how smart technologies that collect, store, and analyze identifiable information, will impact the public’s privacy. Balancing these tradeoffs—improved efficiency versus privacy—is critical because without effective and ongoing oversight, these technologies have the potential to encroach on the public’s privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. \n\nThis report examines the City’s approach to managing privacy risks associated with surveillance technologies, which are tools that track or analyze the movements, behavior, or actions of the public. We found that while some departments are taking steps to address privacy risks, the City’s overall process for evaluating and mitigating risks needs improvement.\n\nWhat We Found\n\nThe City has developed policies and guidelines intended to promote privacy as it works to modernize information technology services and develop smart city applications, including the City’s Privacy Policy, Digital Bill of Rights, Digital Code of Ethics, and Information Security Manual. These and other policies serve as a guide for departments when developing and implementing new solutions, require departments to properly classify sensitive data, and establish standards for information security and access control. \n\nHowever, it is the responsibility of each department to ensure that surveillance technologies and other information systems adhere to City standards, applicable laws, and privacy best practices. This process sometimes lacks transparency, and there are gaps in how departments identify, evaluate, and mitigate privacy risks. Based on a review of citywide privacy policies and the privacy management processes of select departments, we found that:\n\nNeither the City’s existing codes nor its privacy guidelines define what constitutes surveillance technology, which hinders departments’ ability to identify technologies representing elevated privacy risks;\nThe City does not have an inventory identifying surveillance technologies that departments are currently using, making oversight challenging; and\nThe City lacks a formal surveillance technology impact assessment process, which can lead to inconsistencies in how departments evaluate privacy risks, develop use policies, and deploy surveillance technologies.\n\nThese weaknesses highlight the need to supplement the City’s existing privacy policies, and develop tools that ensure privacy risks are systematically identified and mitigated across all City departments.\n\nWhat We Recommend\n\nTechnology that monitors the activities and movement of the public is not necessarily a bad thing, nor something that should automatically be considered an unreasonable privacy violation, so long as the need is justified, and effective controls are in place to ensure the public’s information is safe from improper use or disclosure. This report recommends that the City establish a new surveillance impact assessment and management framework. \n\nSpecifically, the City should:  \n\nClearly define surveillance technology and identify all surveillance technologies used by departments;\nDevelop a standardized surveillance impact assessment and reporting process, and post surveillance impact reports on a single City webpage to ensure the public can easily access the information;\nEstablish a privacy advisory board that meets publicly to review surveillance impact assessments, and oversee departments’ development of surveillance technology privacy policies and controls; and\nRequire departments to update surveillance impact assessments any time a department makes substantial changes to a surveillance system, or how the data from a system will be used, shared, or stored.\n\nBy implementing the framework recommended in this report, the City can build trust as it develops and acquires new technologies. These actions will also promote transparency, and allow City leaders, community stakeholders, and members of the public to see exactly how its government is addressing privacy risks, regardless of how smart technologies evolve in the future.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nNew technologies and the emergence of the connected “smart city” present tremendous opportunities for local governments. Smart cities allow policy makers, public agencies, and local organizations to collaboratively develop integrated programs and applications that can make cities more efficient, and communities better places to live. New technologies, infrastructure, and partnerships also enable cities to collect and analyze more data than ever before, giving public officials and residents new insights into the issues impacting communities. \n\nSmart technologies are already changing how the City of Los Angeles operates. For example, some City streetlights currently or will soon host smart technologies, including air quality monitoring sensors, electric vehicle charging stations, pedestrian traffic sensors, broadband connectivity, and Wi-Fi. Public safety technology is also changing. The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) has partnered with UC San Diego to develop real-time, predictive wildfire models during wildfire events. The technology, called WIFIRE, uses images from planes, maps, and weather data to predict how fires will spread.\n\nThe emergence of new, smarter technologies means that cities are collecting more data about public conditions—and in some cases members of the public—than ever before . Department data highlights how the City of Los Angeles deploys several tools that collect information.\n\nWhile technology innovations and interconnected systems are key in developing smarter and more efficient government, it is critical that the City prioritize the public’s privacy as it pursues smart city initiatives. This is especially important for programs or infrastructure that support surveillance technologies, which are capable of collecting or analyzing personally identifiable information, and other forms of potentially sensitive information.\n\nSurveillance Technologies and Tools\n\nSurveillance technologies and tools can generally be defined as those that analyze the movements, behavior, or actions of identifiable individuals in a manner that can reasonably be expected to raise privacy, civil liberties, or freedom of speech concerns. This can include anything from new smart technologies, such as advanced facial recognition software, to more conventional tools, such as security cameras that monitor public spaces.   \n\nMonitoring the movement of people and conditions in public spaces can provide valuable data that departments and officials can use to improve the delivery of services, and develop policies that address quality of life, accountability, or even environmental concerns. Law enforcement surveillance tools, such as surveillance cameras, can also play an important role in promoting public safety by deterring criminal activity and supporting criminal investigations. \n\nSome cities are making public surveillance cameras a central part of their public safety strategy. The New York Police Department operates a program known as the Domain Awareness System, which is one of the world’s largest networks of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological sensors. The system is designed to detect and prevent terrorist acts, but also provides data for criminal investigations when needed. In 2016, the City of Chicago reported that its Office of Emergency Management and Communication managed a network of more than 27,000 public and private sector surveillance cameras, while the City of Atlanta manages a network of more than 10,000 publicly and privately-owned cameras.\n\nExamples of how local governments use surveillance tools for law enforcement and non-law enforcement purposes are highlighted below.\n\nThe City of Los Angeles does not necessarily use all of these surveillance tools. For example, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) does manage an ALPR program, but does not currently use predictive analytics applications for policing. \n\nAs the City of Los Angeles, like many of its peers, continues to implement new technologies with surveillance capabilities, it must ensure departments collect, analyze, and safeguard data about members of the public in a responsible and ethical manner.\n\nTHE CITY’S APPROACH TO SURVEILLANCE AND PRIVACY\n\nManaging information technology resources across an organization as large as the City of Los Angeles presents challenges. The manner in which City departments manage smart technologies and surveillance tools varies. There are several stakeholders within the City that can weigh in on how to best manage these tools, but no single body is responsible for evaluating the privacy implications and needed safeguards for surveillance technology used by departments.\n\nDepartments Are Ultimately Responsible for the Development of Technology Programs Based on Their Operational Needs\n\nManagement of the City’s information technology systems and resources, and the data that these systems collect and sometimes store, is a joint effort between departments that “own” a system and are the end-user, and the Information Technology Agency (ITA), which coordinates the implementation and management of the City’s technology and digital services. However, it is usually the responsibility of each department to determine whether specific technologies or applications are needed, and how the tools will be used. \n\nThe typical process for developing or acquiring a technology solution is described in the summary chart below. It is important to note that this process can vary based on the type of technology, the scope and cost of the project, and department procurement policies. \n\nOther offices and departments are also involved in the technology development process when a department chooses to work with external vendors. The Office of the City Attorney for example reviews all contracts, while the City Administrative Officer reviews department justifications for contracts.\n\nCitywide Information Technology and Privacy Policies\n\nThe City’s information technology and privacy policies have been established by ITA, the Office of the Mayor, and the Information Technology Policy Committee (ITPC). The ITPC, which is composed of information technology specialists from across the City, works closely with ITA and serves as a steering committee and rulemaking body that develops citywide IT policies.\n\nThe City has developed several policies that reflect City efforts to modernize information services, improve residents’ access to digital services, and promote privacy. Summarized below are key policies and guidelines.\n\nWhile these and other policies serve as important information security and management guidelines for all departments, policy and accountability gaps may result in departments failing to address privacy risks posed by certain technologies. \n\nTransparency, Approvals, and Oversight for City Surveillance Technologies Can Be Inconsistent\n\nThe City’s existing data management and information security policies are critical to ensuring information systems and sensitive records are protected. However, these controls do not always address when it is appropriate to collect information about members of the public without their knowledge, nor do they establish oversight and transparency measures that ensure departments minimize the risk of sensitive data being inappropriately accessed, used, or shared. \n\nThe City does not currently define surveillance technology, nor does it designate any particular official or body as responsible for monitoring City departments’ use of surveillance tools, and other systems that may impact the public’s privacy. This also means the City does not have a single inventory identifying surveillance technologies deployed by departments. Generally, it is the responsibility of each department to:\n\nDetermine when technology that could be considered a surveillance system is needed;\nDevelop or acquire the system, software, or equipment;\nDevelop policies and procedures governing use of the technology and any data that is collected or retained; and\nIn conjunction with the City Attorney’s Office, ensure the technology is used in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations. \n\nWithout specific guidelines for managing privacy risks associated with surveillance technology, departments must develop such programs and evaluate privacy implications on an ad-hoc basis. Those evaluations might also vary based on the instructions provided by a department’s governing board, such as the Board of Police Commissioners or the Fire Commission.   \n\nDepartment Efforts to Evaluate and Mitigate Privacy Concerns\n\nThe lack of a defined privacy management program for City surveillance technologies creates challenges for departments, and hinders City efforts to promote transparency. It also results in policy gaps, as City departments often differ in how they identify, analyze, and address privacy concerns when developing programs that will impact the public’s privacy. \n\nFor example, in February 2020 the California State Auditor issued a report highlighting several weaknesses in the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) management of its ALPR program. The audit, which focused on use of ALPR systems by local law enforcement agencies, found that while the LAPD did publish documents describing their ALPR systems, the department did not have an ALPR privacy policy, as required by state law. Auditors also found LAPD’s user access controls to be insufficient, as all computers assigned to staff, regardless of the employee’s position, included ALPR software. There were approximately 13,000 employees with ALPR system access at the time of the audit. \n\nAccording to the LAPD Office of Constitutional Policing and Policy, the department has since addressed the issues identified by the State Auditor and is in full compliance with State law. However, the State Auditor’s findings highlight the need for a standardized process that supports departments’ efforts to mitigate privacy risks posed by new technologies. \n\nOverall, City departments have taken different approaches to address privacy risks associated with surveillance tools. The chart below provides a high-level summary showing the steps select departments, including LAFD, the Department of Transportation (LADOT), LAPD, and the Bureau of Street Lighting (BSL), have taken to address surveillance technology privacy risks. It is important to note that departments are not necessarily required to complete all of the following privacy assessments when developing a new program, nor are they required to obtain all of the approvals listed below.\n\nInconsistencies in the rollouts of systems and tools with surveillance capabilities highlight the need to supplement the City’s existing privacy policies, and develop a program that provides policymakers and City officials with the information necessary to systematically identify and mitigate privacy risks . Opportunities also exist to make this process more transparent.\n\nLESSONS FROM OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES\n\nFederal agencies, State of California agencies, and several local governments offer lessons in balancing the need to collect information about the public with the need to protect individuals’ civil liberties and fundamental privacy rights. These government entities have implemented technology procurement and management rules specifically designed to address privacy concerns. \n\nFederal and State Strategies \n\nSection 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 requires all federal government agencies that develop or procure new technology involving the collection, management, or dissemination of personally identifiable information to perform comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessments . Federal agencies must show that system owners have incorporated privacy protections throughout the entire lifecycle of a system. The Privacy Impact Assessments must be made publicly available, with some security and competitive business interest exceptions. The law also applies when agencies make substantial changes to existing systems.\n\nState of California agencies are also required to complete privacy assessments similar to those performed by the federal government . State Administrative Manual Section 5310.8 requires information asset owners to conduct a baseline Privacy Threshold Assessment, and if necessary, a comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment, upon acquiring, developing, or making changes to an information system. Privacy Threshold Assessments enable departments to analyze at a high level whether systems will collect, maintain or share private information, such as names, dates of birth, health information, biometric information, physical descriptions, education or employment histories, and license plate data, among other forms of data.\n\nShould a department determine, based on a Privacy Threshold Assessment, that an information system will have an effect on a person’s privacy, it must then perform a Privacy Impact Assessment. When completing a Privacy Impact Assessments, an agency must identify privacy risks associated with the system, and describe steps it will take to mitigate those privacy risks.\n\nSteps Taken by Other Cities \n\nThere are also several local governments that have taken proactive steps to identify and assess technologies that represent a privacy risk . Cities such as New York, Seattle, and Oakland are all examples of jurisdictions that have passed laws establishing standardized privacy evaluation processes for surveillance technologies. All three cities require departments to identify technologies that are used for surveillance purposes, and conduct formal surveillance impact assessments. The City of New York’s law covers only technologies used by its police department.\n\nIn addition to formal surveillance impact assessments, Seattle and Oakland both require additional layers of review and approval. Seattle and Oakland require departments to submit surveillance privacy assessments to a privacy advisory council. The privacy advisory councils, which meet publicly to allow for public comments, evaluate the privacy assessments and recommend additional privacy safeguards as needed. Seattle and Oakland also require city council approval prior to departments deploying surveillance technology, and both cities have worked to retroactively evaluate existing surveillance technologies as well.\n\nMANAGING THE CITY’S PRIVACY RISKS MOVING FORWARD\n\nThe City’s inconsistent approach to managing surveillance technologies stands in contrast to privacy efforts by the federal government, State of California, and other local jurisdictions. These oversight gaps can have negative consequences and foster public distrust. To ensure City departments are adequately protecting the public’s privacy, additional safeguards are needed. \n\nRecommendation\n\nThe City Council should request that the City Legislative Analyst, with assistance from the City Attorney and City Administrative Officer as needed, develop a proposal for the establishment of a new surveillance privacy review process. The proposal should specifically consider implementation of the best practices listed below. \n\nClearly define surveillance technology and identify surveillance technologies used by departments\n\nClearly defining surveillance technology is necessary in order to identify systems and equipment that monitor the movement and activities of the public, regardless of whether the information is collected for law enforcement or non-law enforcement purposes. This definition would guide departments in identifying surveillance technologies already in use, and help them determine whether technology initiatives in the future will require in-depth privacy analysis. \n\nDevelop a standardized surveillance impact assessment and reporting process \n\nThe City should develop a standardized surveillance impact assessment procedure to ensure the City systematically, and consistently vets privacy issues associated with surveillance technology. This would mean that any department planning to introduce a surveillance tool would need to evaluate the program against a standardized set of privacy considerations, and issue a report, prior to deploying the tool. The process should also apply retroactively to existing surveillance tools, and in rare cases where a department must deploy a surveillance tool for public safety reasons prior to completing a privacy impact assessment. \n\nAt a minimum, departments would need to (1) describe the technology and how it will be used, (2) justify the need for the technology, (3) specify whether the technology is subject to any laws or regulations, (4) describe steps the department will take to minimize privacy risks, and (5) present a policy addressing the technology’s use, and data management, access, sharing, and retention protocols. All surveillance impact reports should be posted on a single City webpage to ensure the public can easily access the information. \n\nEstablish a privacy advisory board to support departments’ development of surveillance technology privacy policies and controls\n\nGiven the unique and constantly evolving privacy implications associated with the development of smart cities, the City should establish a privacy advisory board.  The group, which could consist of outside experts, experts from within the City, or a combination of both, would evaluate departments’ surveillance impact reports. Importantly, this advisory board would review the reports during public meetings, allowing members of the public and community organizations to provide input, and outline reasons for supporting or objecting to any elements of a department’s plan.\n\nSpecifically, the board would evaluate whether use of the application or tool is adequately justified, and whether department policies are adequate to safeguard the information collected by the technology. If necessary, the board would recommend additional privacy controls. The review board could also recommend that the use of certain technologies, if particularly sensitive or controversial, be reviewed by the City Council. \n\nRequire departments to update surveillance impact assessments on an ongoing basis\n\nEvaluations of the City’s surveillance tools should evolve as those technologies, or the application of those technologies, change. Departments should update surveillance impact assessments any time a department enhances or makes substantial changes to a surveillance system, or how the data from a system will be used, shared, or stored. This will ensure that City executives, policymakers, and the public are aware of significant program changes.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe emergence of smart, interconnected cities offers tremendous opportunities for innovation and efficiency. However, as the City collects and analyzes more data, it must be transparent, and continuously examine how new and emerging technologies will impact the public’s privacy. By implementing the privacy framework recommended in this report, City leaders, community stakeholders, and members of the public can be confident that departments are safeguarding private information, and mitigating pressing privacy risks as technology evolves.\n\nRECOMMENDATION TABLE"

      "textofpage": "May 20, 2021\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Michael Feuer, City Attorney\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Increasing Local Investment in Los Angeles\n\nAs the City gradually reopens and recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, reviving the local economy and increasing jobs should be a top priority. The nexus between where the City purchases its goods, the sales taxes it pays, and how the local share of sales taxes is allocated presents an opportunity to increase local business participation in City contracting. The following letter details how the City can incorporate sales taxes into its procurement process in a way that leads to more investment in Los Angeles.\n\nThe City purchases many goods yearly\n\nAmong Council-controlled departments, commodities purchases topped $574 million in FY 2020. The top spending categories include software ($41.3M), automobiles ($24.9M), construction machinery and equipment ($22.4M), asphalt ($18.9M) and helicopters/related equipment ($16.8M). City employees use these materials, supplies and equipment during the normal course of their duties.\n\nIn addition, the proprietary departments—Port (POLA), Airports (LAWA), and Water and Power (LADWP)—anticipated $6.4 billion in non-salary expenses for FY 2021. Although this figure also includes expenditures for services, the capital-intensive nature of the proprietary departments’ activities means that they also purchase a significant amount of goods.\n\nPurchases are subject to sales and use taxes\n\nLike other buyers, the City pays sales and use taxes on the tangible goods, which is most often applicable to the materials, equipment and supplies that make up commodities purchases. Sales taxes in Los Angeles are currently 9.5%, consisting of the statewide sales tax rate (7.25%) and an additional district sales tax rate (2.25%). Relative to our commodities purchases between FY 2018 and FY 2020, Council-controlled City departments paid between $32 million and $39 million annually in sales and use taxes.\n\nThe City receives a share of sales tax revenue from all transactions that occur within city limits. Retailers engaged in business in California are generally required to pay sales tax on all retail sales and report the place of sale in their tax returns. The State then allocates a share (1%) of statewide sales taxes to local governments based on the reported place of sale. In FY 2020, the City received $534 million as its local share of statewide sales taxes generated from all purchases made in Los Angeles.\n\nTo level the playing field between California retailers and out-of-state merchants, the State also requires buyers to pay an equivalent use tax on taxable items where sales taxes were not paid. The local share of use tax is allocated to the “place of first use” reported by consumers on their state tax return.\n\nMore local contracting opportunities needed\n\nAs of April 2021, there were over 62,000 active registered businesses with the City’s Business Assistance Virtual Network (BAVN) in order to bid on City contracts. In addition, businesses in L.A. County may qualify to be certified as a Local Business Enterprise (LBE) or a Small Local Business (SLB), which allows City departments to provide preference points when evaluating their bids. As of April 2021, there were 1,219 LBEs and 855 SLBs registered in BAVN.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Contract Administration, the City awarded 377 contracts (worth $403M) in FY 2019 to LBEs. However, only 25 contracts were the result of the City’s local business preference program, while the remaining 352 contracts would have been awarded to the LBEs even without the preference. While the City Council has enacted reforms to address this issue (as elucidated below), more can be done to capture additional tax revenue and keep it in Los Angeles.\n\nTaxes too often go elsewhere\n\nAn unintended consequence of buying from vendors located outside of Los Angeles is that the local government’s share from sales taxes paid by the City goes to other jurisdictions. For example, the City spent $22.6 million in FY 2020 for asphalt and other related goods and services from a vendor based in Carlsbad, San Diego County. The City paid $1.4 million in sales taxes for these purchases. Because the vendor is located in Carlsbad, $150,499 of the $1.4 million in sales taxes paid was likely allocated to the city of Carlsbad.\n\nBased on our estimate shown below, Council-controlled City departments paid out $7 million in sales taxes that were allocated to other jurisdictions in California for commodities purchased from FY 2018 to FY 2020. At the same time, the City paid $4.1 million in sales taxes that were allocated back to the City’s General Fund because they were for commodities purchased from Los Angeles-based vendors.\n\nSales tax data from POLA paints a similar picture, which spent $352.7M on goods and services from FY 2018 to FY 2020, $66.6M (19%) of which was spent on local vendors within city limits. The result was that $394,263 in the local share of sales and use taxes was paid out to other jurisdictions, while $128,544 was allocated back to the City’s General Fund. It is not possible to produce similar estimates for LAWA and LADWP because they do not track sales taxes paid for their transactions.\n\nThe connection between where the City buys its goods and the allocation rules for sales taxes highlights an important point: buying from Los Angeles-based businesses not only increases local investment; it increases the City’s share of sales tax revenue.\n\nReforms help local businesses\n\nRecognizing that where the City spends matters, the Council enacted preference programs designed to increase local business participation in City contracting. Departments can award certified LBEs and SLBs a preference of up to 8% and 10% respectively during the procurement evaluation process.\n\nHowever, even with these preference programs, most of the City’s commodities dollars are spent on vendors located outside of Los Angeles. Between FY 2018 through FY 2020, only 18% of the City’s commodities spending went to vendors within Los Angeles.\n\nTo further enhance contracting opportunities for local businesses, the City Council has adopted changes to the City’s local business preference program. These changes include:\n\nCombining the LBE, SLB and Transitional Job Opportunity Programs into a single Local Business preference program.\nModifying qualifying contract thresholds for the program, giving departments the authority to award up to a 12% preference during the procurement evaluation process.\n\nAs Los Angeles is set to host the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympic Games, the City and other regional government partners are planning to work together to make these events successful. These combined regional efforts could include significant contracting opportunities. If well-coordinated, contracting by the City, the County and Metro could become the basis for potential cooperative purchasing agreements that combine our collective power in a way that benefits the regional economy.\n\nCity Council recommendations\n\nWhile the City Council recently made changes to the local business preference program, it should also consider increasing the bid preference further to account for the local allocation of sales taxes paid to Los Angeles-based vendors. In addition, changes should be made to the City’s contracts to encourage vendors to use Los Angeles-based locations as the place of sale when possible.\n\nTo enact these changes, we propose the following recommendations:\n\nINSTRUCT the General Services Department, Bureau of Contract Administration and other related departments to assess the feasibility of incorporating the allocation of the 1% local sales tax into the procurement process. This may be in the form of a 1% price discount during the bid evaluation for qualifying local bidders selling taxable goods to the City or a 1% increase to the maximum bid preference that can be awarded to Local Businesses located in Los Angeles.\nREQUEST the City Attorney to draft a standard provision to include in the City’s contracts that requests vendors to use a City-based location as the principal place of negotiation or shipment whenever feasible, and if doing so does not impose an additional cost to the City and the vendor.\nREQUEST the Mayor’s Chief Procurement Officer to work with the County, Metro and other regional government partners to analyze spending data and identify common purchasing categories that can be used for potential cooperative purchasing agreements in the future.\n\nDepartment recommendations\n\nIn addition, departments should collect information to enhance the City’s ability to determine the amount of sales taxes paid out to other jurisdictions and increase local purchasing while recycling sales taxes paid into the General Fund.\n\nLAWA and LADWP should begin recording sales taxes paid in their transactions to account for sales taxes paid for local and non-local purchases; and\nIf presented with the same bid scores between a qualified goods vendor located in Los Angeles and other qualified vendors located outside of the City, departments should choose a vendor located in Los Angeles in order to increase local investment and maximize the amount of local sales taxes allocated back to the City.\n\nThe City has an opportunity to increase local purchasing by adopting and implementing these recommendations. We can support local businesses and recycle an increasing share of sales taxes paid into our General Fund, which will benefit all Angelenos.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller"

We do this through our 24-hour telephone hotline and web-based complaint form, citywide education and training programs, and proactive investigations. The activity of the FWA Unit in 2020 is the subject of this report.\n\nLast calendar year, my office’s FWA Unit started with 72 ongoing cases, fielded 460 new complaints and ultimately closed 494 total cases — with 25 complaints substantiated and 111 referred to City departments for further action. The most frequent allegation was waste of City resources, accounting for 19 percent of all cases.\n\nExamples of FWA Unit results:\n\nDiscovered that a community-based organization funded through the Economic and Workforce Development Department overbilled the City for nearly $33,000 and lacked support for costs billed to the program. As a result of the investigation, the department is seeking to suspend the agency’s contract and recover the full grant amount disbursed ($294,000), if acceptable support documentation cannot be provided.\nUncovered that exempt Bureau of Sanitation employees had inappropriately received overtime payments totaling $209,000 over a three-year period, resulting in repayment agreements and corrective measures.\nFound that a Bureau of Sanitation employee violated benefit regulations by covering an unqualified dependent, prompting the employee’s resignation and repayment of nearly $63,000 of City-paid health and dental benefits.\nEstablished that the Los Angeles Fire Department had an inefficient permitting process that resulted in numerous pending permits, long customer wait times and hundreds of thousands of dollars of lost City revenue.\n\nEarlier this year, an updated version of the fraud, waste and abuse online training was deployed to City departments, which should have been completed by all employees by April 1. This tool has proven extremely effective in educating employees about what constitutes prohibited behavior and what to do if they witness it.\n\nAs stewards of the public’s trust, we have a shared responsibility to hold City departments and employees to the highest standards of service. My office will continue to do everything possible with the limited resources available to reduce fraud, waste and abuse of our vital public resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe Office of the City Controller’s Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) Unit was established to screen, monitor, and investigate allegations of FWA involving City resources. To support the integrity of City operations, the Unit receives, analyzes, investigates, and reports on allegations of FWA that impact City resources.\n\nDuring 2020, the FWA Unit received 460 cases, a decrease of 15% from the 543 cases received in the prior year. The all-time high number of cases received during 2019 was attributed to an enhanced Fraud Awareness Training developed by the FWA Unit, which is part of the City’s required bi-annual training curriculum.\n\nThe FWA Unit has created a refreshed version of the Fraud Awareness Training which was deployed to all Departments citywide in January 2021. This training is a key resource for employees to help them remain knowledgeable about fraud risks and understand how to identify potential fraud, waste and abuse in their work setting.\n\nThe City’s definition of Fraud, Waste and Abuse is as follows:\n\n\n2020 CASE OUTCOMES\n\nThe following highlights note the key outcomes from several substantiated cases for reviews and investigations that were conducted by, or in collaboration with, the FWA Unit during 2020:\n\nGRANT FUNDED AGENCY CONCERNS\nA Community Based Organization funded through EWDD was alleged to have over-recovered its costs. Our investigation substantiated that the agency billed and received reimbursement from both the City and another entity for a program employee, over-recovering nearly $33,000. In addition, the agency lacked support for allocating its costs to the City-funded program, which had also been noted by EWDD fiscal monitors. EWDD is pursuing suspension of the agency’s contract, and recovery of the full grant amount disbursed ($294,000) if the agency cannot provide acceptable support.\nA hotline tip alleged that a City contractor falsified the time records that were used to support requests for reimbursements under a City program contract. The FWA Unit investigation found that the contractor did not list the correct work hours and pay rates on the reimbursement requests, as the contractor was trying to ensure its staff received their full pay as salaried employees. The report recommended that the City Department overseeing the program provide training to the contractor regarding their billing expectations and ensure no overpayments occurred.\nEMPLOYEE MISUSE OF CITY RESOURCES\nTwo separate reports were made to the FWA hotline alleging misuse of parking access cards. In one case, a Bureau of Street Services employee was found to be inappropriately using a City parking keycard that belonged to another employee to circumvent the City’s parking waitlist. The second case involved a City employee allowing a non-employee to use their parking placard. In both cases, the employees received disciplinary action for violation of the City’s parking card usage policy.\nA Zoo employee was found to have misused a City vehicle by using it to drive to lunch with coworkers. The employee received disciplinary action. The City has a strict policy on the appropriate use of City vehicles.\nPAYROLL OVERPAYMENTS AND BENEFITS FUND\nA hotline tip alleged that multiple Sanitation employees had inappropriately received overtime payments totaling $209,000 over a three-year period, even though their positions were FLSA exempt. The investigation included review of FLSA policy and MOU agreements and concluded the allegation was substantiated. The employees entered into repayment agreements which are currently pending as their Union is negotiating on their behalf. The Department addressed the misunderstanding of labor policy and MOU agreements to prevent this from occurring in the future.\nA Sanitation employee violated benefit regulations by covering an ex-spouse for City-paid health and dental benefits. The employee was ordered to repay nearly $63,000, the value of premiums paid by the City over fourteen years for the ex-spouse. The employee resigned shortly after the investigation concluded; we also ensured that the ex-spouse would not receive benefits through the City’s retirement system.\nMISUSE OF AUTHORITY\nA DWP employee was investigated and confirmed to be working on unreported outside employment during assigned work hours, and had used Department property for this personal use. The employee received disciplinary action and was reminded of City policies that require management approval for all outside employment.\nAn Airport director and employee were investigated based on allegations of misusing authority or position. The investigation revealed that the director failed to protect City assets, engaged in outside business with the employee who was under their supervision, and violated other Department policies. The director was discharged based on the investigation’s findings. The employee was found to have falsified time records and engaged in the outside business during work hours, and resigned following the investigation and disciplinary process.\nWASTE OR INEFFICIENCY OF CITY RESOURCES\nA process review prompted by a hotline tip found that a City Department had an inefficient permitting processthat resulted in numerous pending permits, long wait times for customers, and lost City revenue which was estimated to reach hundreds of thousands of dollars. The review identified inefficiencies and control weaknesses and made specific recommendations to Department management for improvement.\nThe FWA Unit initiated a review into select purchase card transactions that were identified as potential waste of funds for prepayments made prior to the COVID-19 related shutdown of non-essential businesses. As a result of the Department’s review into the selected transactions, refund requests were initiated to recover the prepayments totaling $12,500 that would otherwise have been lost.\n2020 CASE METRICS\nCASE STATUS\n\nThe following chart summarizes caseload count for the calendar year.\n\nDuring 2020, the FWA Unit closed a total of 494 cases. The case closure by category is summarized in the following chart.\n\nCASE ANALYSIS BY ISSUE TYPE\n\nWaste or inefficiency of City resources was the leading type of issue reported among the cases closed during the year; accounting for 15 of the 81 cases that required an investigation or review.\n\nCASE ANALYSIS BY LOCATION\n\nThe cases requiring investigation or review by Department, and the number of cases referred to Departments for action are as follows:\n\nFWA UNIT PROCESS\nCASE INTAKE\n\nThe FWA Unit can receive cases from any City Department, Office, or employee, as well as any member of the public. Cases are primarily received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through a web intake form that can be accessed at lacontroller.org/fraud_hotline or via the hotline phone number (866) 428-1514.\n\nAny person submitting a complaint or allegation to the FWA Unit may do so anonymously. The City’s Ethics Ordinance protects whistleblowers who report or attempt to report possible violations of law from retaliation. Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to whistleblower retaliation may file a confidential complaint with the City Ethics Commission, which shall investigate and take appropriate action. Information regarding the FWA Unit’s cases may not be disclosed, except as necessary to conduct investigations, facilitate referrals for appropriate action, or if required by law.\n\nDuring 2020, most of cases received by the FWA Unit were reported anonymously. Ninety-six percent of the cases were received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline, either through the web intake form or the toll-free phone number. A small number of cases were received via email, U.S. mail, or in-person.\n\nExcept when prohibited by law, Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 20.60.4 requires City departments and appointed Offices to report to the Controller’s Office FWA Unit any matter involving potential FWA within ten days of discovery of information that reasonably indicates that the matter involves FWA of City resources.\n\nCASE EVALUATION\n\nThe FWA Unit evaluates every case received. This includes a thorough review of all information submitted by the reporting party and can include FWA staff reviewing City data or other public databases and other information to thoughtfully evaluate the issues. Based on this evaluation, the FWA Unit will then determine whether the allegations: 1) are outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and/or have no FWA impact; 2) are non-FWA investigative matters that should be referred to another City Department or jurisdiction for appropriate action; or 3) are FWA investigative matters that require an investigation or review to be conducted by the FWA Unit or a City Department. The FWA Unit may also conduct joint investigations with other entities as appropriate.\n\nCases evaluated as outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction include those that are unrelated to City operations, involve personnel-related matters, and cases for which there are no FWA issues alleged. Nevertheless, these cases may be referred to the appropriate outside agency or City Department for their consideration. For example, in 2020 several cases cited COVID-19 safety concerns and phone scammers posing as utility employees; these were referred to the applicable City Department, LADWP, or law enforcement, as appropriate. If the complaint is based solely on the reporter’s opinion, or the reported risk has been addressed through a City policy change, the case will be closed with no further action. If the matter is the subject of pending or current litigation, the case will be referred to the Office of the City Attorney.\n\nCases evaluated as requiring a referral to another City Department or other jurisdiction for appropriate action are non-FWA investigative matters. These are issues best suited for the Department to take action on, but do not warrant an investigation focused on the impact to City resources. Examples include minor employee misconduct and customer service issues.\n\nCases evaluated as FWA investigative matters are those that have sufficient information, as garnered through the FWA Unit’s research into the allegation or documentation provided by the reporting party, which provide a reasonable basis that a FWA matter occurred or is still occurring. The case may be assigned to a City Department for investigation or be investigated by FWA Unit staff, especially when the case requires forensic review of financial records, is more complex, or may be widespread due to lax internal controls."

One basic yardstick that can be used by even casual passersby is the presence of trash and debris in public places. The City of Los Angeles is responsible for maintaining the sidewalks, streets and alleyways within its boundaries, collectively known as the public right-of-way (PROW). It does this by fixing cracks and potholes, trimming trees and paving streets. The PROW is open for use by anyone, giving pedestrians, cyclists and drivers the opportunity to get where they need to be.\n\nBut what is open for use by everyone is being abused by too many. Businesses and individuals are illegally dumping more and more garbage, debris and harmful substances in the City’s PROW, contributing to urban blight and public health risks and leading to a lesser quality of life in impacted neighborhoods. Illegal dumping is also a serious environmental crime, as trash dumped in L.A.’s drains flows untreated into our local waterways. Common illegally dumped materials include paint, appliances, construction and demolition waste, household trash and used motor oil.\n\nThe City’s push to eliminate illegal dumping and the damage it causes our communities is the subject of my latest report. Overall, my office found that the City must do more to tackle this serious issue and address the causes that lead to it.\n\nOverburdened and spread thin\n\nIn recent years, as illegal dumping service requests have climbed, the City has put more resources into PROW cleanup efforts spearheaded by the Bureau of Sanitation (LASAN). But even with funding for new cleanup crews and equipment, LASAN is struggling to keep up with the high demand for services. Illegal dumping service requests have spiked nearly 450% — going from an average of 457 requests per month in 2016 to approximately 2,500 requests per month in 2020. And the amount of solid waste picked up by LASAN in the PROW has similarly piled up, increasing from nearly 9,200 tons in 2016 to 14,500 tons through the first eight months of 2020.\n\nThe fact that LASAN manages both illegal dumping and homeless encampment cleanups has compounded its logistical and operational challenges. It is taking LASAN an average of five days to respond to illegal dumping service requests — a considerable amount of time to leave unsightly and potentially dangerous waste sitting in the City’s PROW. And while there is a nexus between illegal dumping and encampments, the issues are distinct, although scofflaws can and do use encampments as dumping grounds, worsening living conditions for unhoused individuals.\n\nIn addition, LASAN is tasked with investigating illegal dumping incidents with limited capacity. There are only 19 illegal dumping surveillance cameras stationed across our 470 square mile metropolis. Enforcement too is problematic as there is no comprehensive strategy to approach the issue, despite the fact that enforcement involves several departments, including LASAN, the Bureau of Street Services, the Los Angeles Police Department and the City Attorney’s Office.\n\nThere is also currently little work put into educating the public about the impacts of illegal dumping and the need to properly dispose of business, construction and household waste. A coordinated and concerted awareness campaign is needed to notify residents about the right way to dispose of excess trash, underscore that illegal dumping is both harmful and criminal, and encourage people to report it if they see it. Such a campaign should involve input from residents and stakeholders in communities that disproportionately bear the brunt of illegal dumping.\n\nGreater accountability \n\nWithout a strategy to improve the City’s efforts to clean up abandoned waste and hold accountable those responsible, Los Angeles will continue to see more trash and struggle to keep up with simply picking it up. My report recommends the following actions to address the causes of the problem and improve the City’s ability to investigate illegal dumping cases and enforce applicable laws:\n\nIncrease the number of dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews to boost LASAN’s cleanup capacity and responsiveness.\nReorganize LASAN’s enforcement and investigations unit to improve its mitigation activities and expand the illegal dumping surveillance camera program.\nEstablish an interdepartmental working group to identify trends and coordinate illegal dumping enforcement activities.\nConsider increasing fines for those caught dumping illegally and boost oversight of commercial trash customers and construction projects to ensure proper trash disposal.\nCreate a public awareness campaign to address illegal dumping issues and tell Angelenos about free and low-cost trash disposal services.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the City can be more aggressive with its illegal dumping response, resulting in cleaner communities and a safer, healthier environment.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMade up primarily of the City’s sidewalks, streets, and alleyways, the public right-of-way (PROW) is an essential part of daily life in Los Angeles. The PROW is space that is sometimes taken for granted—Angelenos use it to drive to work, walk to school, and patronize local businesses. Sadly, businesses and individuals are illegally dumping garbage and debris in the PROW with increasing frequency. \n\nThe proliferation of illegal dumping in Los Angeles has a direct negative impact on public health conditions, public safety, and the environment. Each year, the City’s Bureau of Sanitation, better known as Los Angeles Sanitation and Environment (LASAN), responds to tens of thousands of requests for illegal dumping site cleanups, and recovers thousands of tons of waste during those cleanups. LASAN is also the lead department tasked with investigating illegal dumping incidents. \n\nThis report examines the City’s efforts to eliminate illegal dumping and reduce the health, safety, and environmental impact of illegally dumped waste. Overall, we found that the City should do more to tackle this serious issue, and address the root causes. \n\nWhat We Found\n\nIn recent years, LASAN has ramped up its PROW cleanup program, adding new cleanup crews and equipment. However, illegal dumping service requests have steadily increased since 2017, and keeping up with the demand is a challenge, as LASAN’s cleanup crews must respond to illegal dumping complaints in addition to performing public health cleanups at homeless encampments. In 2017, LASAN’s Livability Services Division received an average of 850 illegal dumping service requests per month. From January through September 2020, LASAN received an average of 2,494 requests per month—nearly three times the amount in 2017. LASAN’s illegal dumping cleanup response time currently stands at an average of five days. \n\nSeveral issues are hindering the City’s ability to stop illegal dumping. \n\nLASAN’s investigation and enforcement capacity is limited – LASAN’s enforcement unit lacks the capacity to carry out its multiple enforcement programs, and operates just 19 illegal dumping surveillance cameras across the entire City. The City also lacks a comprehensive illegal dumping enforcement strategy, which may be needed because illegal dumping enforcement involves several departments, including LASAN, the Bureau of Street Services, the Police Department, and the City Attorney’s Office.    \nMore should be done to address the sources of illegal dumping – The City needs to be more aggressive in eliminating illegally dumped waste generated by businesses, residents, and construction projects. Specifically, the City could benefit from a concerted and coordinated public awareness campaign that makes Angelenos aware of the harmful impacts of dumping, and advertises free and low-cost options for disposing of excess waste and bulky items. The City should also bolster its oversight of businesses and construction projects to ensure they are properly disposing of waste. \nWhat We Recommend  \n\nThe City must take aggressive steps to eliminate hazards and blight in the PROW, hold those responsible for illegal dumping accountable, and reduce the amount of waste that ends up in public spaces. This report makes several recommendations intended to improve the City’s illegal dumping abatement and enforcement capabilities. \n\nSpecifically, the City should:\n\nConsider increasing the number of permanent, dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews to boost LASAN’s cleanup capacity and responsiveness;\nReorganize LASAN’s enforcement and investigations unit to improve effectiveness of its pollution mitigation activities;\nExpand LASAN’s illegal dumping surveillance camera program to improve investigators’ ability to monitor hotspots;\nEstablish an interdepartmental working group or task force to identify and share trends, and coordinate illegal dumping enforcement activities;\nConsider increasing administrative citation fines for those caught dumping illegally;\nDevelop a public awareness campaign which makes Angelenos aware of free and low-cost trash disposal services, and explore ways to make it easier for residents to legally dispose of excess waste;\nBoost oversight of commercial trash customers and construction projects to ensure waste is properly disposed of; and \nPursue new funding opportunities to support the expansion of illegal dumping abatement programs.\n\nBy implementing the solutions proposed in this report, the City can protect the environment, and reduce the blight, hazards, and health risks posed by illegal dumping. Angelenos deserve safe, clean public spaces, and the City should not allow illegal dumping to continue diminishing quality of life for Los Angeles residents. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAn essential duty of any state or local government is to maintain the space known as the public right-of-way (PROW). Consisting largely of sidewalks, streets, and alleyways, the PROW is the public space in which pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles have the right to proceed. The City of Los Angeles maintains these spaces in many ways, such as paving streets, repairing potholes, trimming street trees, and emptying litter bins. These and other maintenance activities are intended to help make the streets and sidewalks Angelenos use every day safe and passable.\n\nHowever, far too often, businesses and individuals are choosing to illegally dump garbage, debris, and other harmful substances in the City’s PROW. In certain parts of the City, piles of waste and debris are becoming increasingly common. Illegal dumping is a major contributor to urban blight, but the impact on local communities does not stop there. Illegal dumping also creates serious public safety hazards, public health risks, and environmental damage. Given these risks, it is critical that the City does its part to prevent and deter bad actors from harming our communities. \n\nThe purpose of this review is to evaluate the City’s efforts to clean up abandoned waste, and hold accountable those responsible for dumping waste in public spaces. This report offers several recommendations intended to address illegal dumping root causes, and improve the City’s ability to investigate illegal dumping cases and enforce illegal dumping laws.\n\nThe Impact of Illegal Dumping on the Community \n\nIllegal dumping is a major contributor to the build-up of waste and debris on streets, alleyways, and sidewalks. It is the result of unscrupulous businesses and individuals failing to properly dispose of solid waste or hazardous waste, such as common trash, appliances, paint, construction and demolition waste, and used motor oil. Businesses that dump waste also gain an unfair competitive advantage over those that pay proper waste disposal costs. Those who dump illegally do not necessarily respect city boundaries, and it is not uncommon for people to travel into the City of Los Angeles to discard waste, likely due to a perceived lack of consequences.\n\nThe health, safety, and environmental impacts of illegal dumping and the accumulation of trash and harmful substances in the PROW are highlighted below. \n\nThere is also a nexus between illegal dumping and the accumulation of debris and bulky items at homeless encampments. While homeless encampments and illegal dumping are two distinct issues, they often exist within the same spaces. This is because illegal dumpers sometimes seek out spaces that are already impacted by poor sanitary conditions. Illegal dumping at encampments or in adjacent spaces only worsens unhealthy living conditions for unhoused individuals. \n\nRecognizing that illegally dumped waste represents a risk to both the public and the environment, the City has dedicated additional resources in recent years to help clean up illegal dumping sites, and mitigate health and safety risks associated with encampments. However, stemming the flow of illegally dumped waste on streets, sidewalks, and alleyways continues to be a major challenge for City officials.\n\nEfforts to Mitigate Blight and Hazards Stemming from Illegal Dumping \n\nThe Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation, better known as LA Sanitation and Environment (LASAN), is the lead agency responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the PROW, and ensuring it is passable and free of trash and hazardous debris. Within LASAN, two groups carry out these activities:\n\nMultiple federal, State, and local laws prohibit dumping waste illegally in public spaces. Management of the City’s stormwater system and illegal dumping abatement programs is also subject to federal and State regulation due to its impact on local water quality. Although LASAN is the lead City department responsible for illegal dumping abatement and watershed protection, there are other City departments that play a role in combating illegal dumping. \n\nSpecifically, other departments with law enforcement powers, including the Bureau of Street Services (BSS) and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), support the City’s cleanliness and public health efforts by enforcing illegal dumping and other PROW safety laws. The Recreation and Parks Department enforces illegal dumping laws in parks, and cleans up illegally dumped waste on park property.   \n\nLASAN Cleanup Teams and Operations\n\nThe City’s PROW cleanup teams were cut back to the point of near elimination during the Great Recession. As the City’s fiscal condition improved, and as a result of both increases in illegal dumping activity and the growing unhoused population in Los Angeles, the City gradually increased the number of cleanup teams in the field and the scope of their responsibilities. Between 2012 and 2016, the City rolled out three new programs dedicated to maintaining safe PROW conditions. \n\nIn October 2019, the City consolidated the Clean Streets LA and the Homeless Outreach and Proactive Enforcement programs to create the Comprehensive Cleaning and Rapid Engagement (CARE) program. Operation Healthy Streets (OHS) remains a standalone initiative, focusing on Skid Row and Venice. The CARE program introduced a new service delivery model for the City’s cleanup teams, which included regionally deployed teams in problem areas, teams dedicated to each Council District, and citywide teams. The launch of the CARE program also brought 47 new hires, bringing the number of City workers serving on Livability Services Division cleanup teams and in other support roles to nearly 260. \n\nHowever, in early 2021, due to budget cuts following the COVID-19 crisis, the Livability Services Division was forced to reduce staffing by 61 positions. Though the Livability Services Division believes the reductions will be temporary, it was forced to again reorganize the program and make changes to deployment models. \n\nLivability Services Division Cleanup Teams\n\nThere are currently two distinct types of teams under the CARE Program, while OHS crew makeup has remained largely the same. The Livability Services Division also deploys small teams to illegal dumping sites throughout the City. All crews focus on mitigating PROW hazards, and improving public health conditions. The services, staffing, and geographic responsibilities of Livability Services Division teams as of February 2021 are described in the chart below.  \n\nThe competing priorities of the Livability Services Division—encampment and illegal dumping cleanups—require the division to balance constantly changing workload demands across the City. While Livability Services Division cleanup crews dedicate the majority of their time to encampment cleanups, LASAN managers report that the CARE program’s deployment model has improved the responsiveness and efficiency of cleanup crews.\n\nIt is important to note that there are certain areas in the City where LASAN is not responsible for abating illegal dumping:\n\nprivate property is the responsibility of the property owner;\nfreeways corridors, and freeway ramps are the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans); \nrailroad corridors are the responsibility of Caltrans or the railroad owner; and\ncertain portions of the LA River, which, depending on location, may be the responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the County of Los Angeles, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, and/or the City. \nCity Investment in PROW Cleanup Operations \n\nThe City dedicates a considerable level of financial resources to PROW cleanup operations. Not only does the City fund CARE+, CARE, OHS, and illegal dumping teams, but it pays for a variety of contracting and support costs as well, such as specialized hazardous waste mitigation services to dispose of dangerous biohazards and chemicals.\n\nIn FY2019-20, LASAN spent approximately:\n\n$39 million on Livability Services Division cleanup crews, including salaries, expenses, and indirect costs such as benefits and overhead costs; and \n$8.4 million on contract hazardous waste disposal services.\n\nIn FY2020-21, LASAN is spending approximately: \n\n$53 million on Livability Services Division cleanup crews, including salaries, expenses, and indirect costs, and is on track to accrue a similar or slightly greater amount on contract hazardous waste disposal services.  \n\nThe expansion of Livability Services Division cleanup teams has also required a sizable capital investment of $34 million for fleet vehicles and heavy equipment. Because the acquisition of fleet vehicles and equipment will be financed over time through the Municipal Investment Corporation of Los Angeles (the City’s nonprofit financing corporation), LASAN must rent some equipment while it awaits the delivery of necessary equipment. The division accrued approximately $7.8 million in fleet rental costs during the 2019-20 fiscal year. \n\nIt is important to note that the economic crisis caused by COVID-19 is having a serious, and sometimes unpredictable impact on the City’s budget. LASAN’s FY2020-21 budget and spending may be adjusted throughout the fiscal year.\n\nIMPROVING CLEANUP CAPACITY AND RESPONSE TIMES\n\nLASAN has observed a large increase in the number of illegal dumping cleanup service requests in recent years. The expansion of Livability Services Division cleanup programs has improved the department’s ability to respond to illegal dumping incidents. However, further increasing illegal dumping cleanup capacity could enhance the department’s responsiveness and mitigate the negative environmental and quality of life impacts of illegal dumping.\n\nIllegal Dumping Cleanup Operations and Workload Trends \n\nAny member of the public can report illegally dumped waste to the City. LASAN primarily receives reports of illegal dumping via the LASAN call center, MyLA311, and the LASAN website. Angelenos can also submit crime tips about suspected illegal dumping activities to help LASAN investigators. Upon receiving a service request reporting illegally dumped waste, LASAN routes the request to Livability Services Division crews via SANSTAR, its service request management system.\n\nIn recent years, the department has observed a major increase in service requests, a trend which continued in 2020. In 2017, the department received an average of 850 service requests per month. From January through September 2020, the department received an average of 2,494 requests per month, nearly triple the amount compared to 2017. \n\nCertain City Council Districts have seen substantial increases in the number of illegal dumping reports. From January through September 2020, Council Districts 2,3,4,6,7, and 9 saw the average number of service requests per month increase more than 250 percent compared to 2017. \n\nThe chart below shows the total number of illegal dumping service requests citywide from 2017 through September 2020, as well as the corresponding monthly average. It is important to note that multiple service requests can be received for the same illegal dumping site. See Appendix A for a full breakdown of service requests, including service requests in each Council District. \n\nThe increase in illegal dumping service requests has resulted in a substantial increase in the Livability Services Division’s workload. This is in addition to the division’s homeless encampment cleanup responsibilities, which already strains resources. From January through September of 2020, the Livability Services Division was receiving an average of 4,020 encampment cleanup requests per month. \n\nSolid Waste Dumped in the PROW   \n\nData provided by LASAN shows that the amount of waste picked up by LASAN crews has steadily increased in recent years. In 2015, the department picked up approximately 8,900 tons of illegally dumped waste. In 2019, the department picked up nearly 16,000 tons of illegally dumped waste, and was on track to exceed that amount in 2020. The chart below shows the amount of solid waste picked up by Livability Services Division crews since 2015. \n\nImportantly, illegal dumping in the PROW also impacts the City’s unsheltered residents, as illegal dumpers sometimes target areas with encampments when illegally dumping waste and debris. This exacerbates poor sanitary conditions at encampments, creating additional health and safety risks. For example, LASAN estimates that from January through August of 2020, crews collected the following amounts and types of waste during homeless encampment cleanups: \n\n5,661 tons of solid waste and debris;\n34,340 lbs. of paint waste;\n33,107 lbs. of oil waste; and\n9,347 lbs. of corrosives (materials that can destroy body tissue).\n\nSome of this waste can be attributed to illegal dumping, and it contributes to the dangerous conditions unhoused Angelenos face while living on the streets. See Appendix B for a full breakdown of waste collected at encampments.\n\nCleanup Response Times\n\nWhen LASAN receives an illegal dumping service request, an employee verifies the dumping site, and the request is then assigned to a Livability Services Division cleanup crew. Although illegal dumping incidents and cleanup requests are becoming more frequent, the establishment of the CARE program improved the ability of the Livability Services Division to respond to illegal dumping. In 2017, it took LASAN an average of nine days to respond to an illegal dumping complaint. That number is down to five in 2020.  \n\nThe chart below shows citywide average response times since 2017. See Appendix C for a full breakdown of response times in each Council District.\n\nImproved response times are encouraging, and reflect the benefits of implementing new crews and deployment strategies. However, given the public safety, health, and environmental risks posed by illegally dumped waste, the City should consider how to further reduce response times and eliminate waste in public spaces. \n\nFurther Reducing LASAN Response Times\n\nOpportunities may exist for LASAN to further reduce response times for illegal dumping cleanups, given the increasing workload demands associated with both illegal dumping, and the proliferation of encampments. Prior to February 2021, when the division temporarily reorganized its operations due to budget constraints, the Livability Services Division did not have dedicated illegal dumping crews. Instead, CARE+, CARE, and Operation Healthy Streets teams responded to illegal dumping sites within their geographic area of responsibility. \n\nThe Livability Services Division was able to deploy teams dedicated to illegal dumping in part because the City, consistent with U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 guidance, has suspended most of its comprehensive homeless encampment cleanup operations. Although this operational change has temporarily freed up staffing resources for illegal dumping activities, the City will need to balance encampment cleanup backlogs and illegal dumping cleanups when the pandemic subsides.  \n\nTo that end, LASAN should consider expanding its illegal dumping cleanup capacity, and increasing the number of permanent, dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews it operates. The establishment of additional crews that would respond only to illegal dumping could improve the division’s ability to quickly dispatch crews to illegal dumping sites. It would also boost LASAN’s cleanup capacity for homeless encampments by freeing up certain Livability Services Division crews to be fully dedicated to encampment cleanups. Prior to March 2020, when the City suspended most encampment cleanups due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was taking Livability Services Division crews 71 days to respond to encampment cleanup service requests, on average. \n\nFor FY 2020-21 the approximate cost of a standard CARE team is $1.4 million, including benefits, indirect costs, and expenses. Crew operations are funded primarily through the City’s General Fund, which supports a variety of core government functions like police and fire services. Though the City’s General Fund and budget outlook are weaker as a result of COVID-19’s dire economic impact, LASAN can examine the use of special fund revenue, specifically from the Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund, to fund new, dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews. \n\nLos Angeles Municipal Code Section 64.51.11 authorizes the City to use Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund monies for storm drainage purposes, including stormwater pollution control activities. Because illegally dumped waste pollutes the stormwater system and local bodies of water, crews dedicated solely to illegal dumping abatement would be dedicated to stormwater pollution control, consistent with Los Angeles Municipal Code requirements. The Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund is discussed in further detail later in this report. \n\nRecommendation\n\nTo improve the City’s ability to respond to illegally dumped waste and related hazards, LASAN should:\n\nAssess the feasibility of implementing new, dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews, and explore the use of Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund monies or other special funds to support the establishment of new crews.\nPRIORITIZING INVESTIGATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT\n\nBlight and health and safety hazards are not the only problems posed by illegal dumping. The City of Los Angeles operates what is known as a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4). An MS4 is a conveyance system in which stormwater runoff flows from impervious surfaces, including streets, sidewalks, and gutters, into a storm drain system that drains untreated into local waterways. As stormwater flows over the City’s streets and other impervious surfaces, it sweeps up pollutants such as oils, chemicals, pathogens, and sediments, which has a direct negative impact on water quality. \n\nThe impact of illegal dumping on the City’ connected sewer system highlights the need to revamp the City’s investigation and enforcement programs. This will improve its ability to identify and hold accountable individuals choosing to dump illegally.\n\nIllegal Dumping Laws and Regulations \n\nThe City of Los Angeles operates its stormwater system under the County of Los Angeles’ National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System MS4 permit, which is required by the federal Clean Water Act and issued by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board. LASAN’s Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit within the Watershed Protection Division is responsible for investigating illegal dumping and responding to hazardous waste incidents.\n\nSeveral federal, State, and local laws prohibit dumping waste illegally in public spaces. The Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit is a law enforcement and compliance unit within LASAN, and can cite individuals or develop cases for criminal prosecution under any applicable illegal dumping or pollution runoff control law. There are four laws that are central to illegal dumping enforcement activities. \n\nWhen the City identifies an individual that has illegally dumped waste in the PROW, it can enforce illegal dumping laws in one of several ways based on the severity of the violation, and the discretion of code enforcement officers, law enforcement officers, or prosecutors working on the case. Illegal dumping laws are usually punished as infractions or misdemeanors, though prosecutors can develop felony cases for egregious violations. \n\nGenerally, illegal dumping violations of the Municipal Code considered to be infractions (similar to a traffic ticket) are punishable by fines of up to $200 for the first violation, and $250 for the second violation, while violations prosecuted as misdemeanors are punishable by fines of up to $1,000 and up to six months imprisonment in jail. Violators are also liable for cleanup costs. Fines and jail time prescribed in the City’s illegal dumping codes are limited by State laws and the Los Angeles Municipal Code. \n\nThe California Penal Code laws covering illegal dumping offer stricter fines than the Municipal Code, in addition to possible imprisonment. Under the Penal Code, cases prosecuted as infractions are typically punishable by a fine of between $250-$1,000 for the first violation, $500-$1,500 for the second violation, and $750-$3,000 for a third violation. Illegally dumping waste in commercial quantities is punishable as a misdemeanor, and subject to fines of up to $10,000. Dumping hazardous waste is also subject to fines of up to $10,000.\n\nIn lieu of infraction and misdemeanor cases, which are processed in the court system, the City’s investigators and prosecutors can process some Municipal Code violations through the City Attorney’s Administrative Citation Enforcement (ACE) program. The ACE program is a noncriminal approach to nuisance abatement and quality of life offenses. The program assesses fines, rather than arrests, incarceration, and criminal records, for people who violate the Municipal Code. The ACE program fines for LAMC 64.70.02 and LAMC 66.25 violations range from $250-$500 for the first offense, $500-$750 for the second offense, and $1,000 for the third and any subsequent offense. \n\nThe Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit within LASAN’s Watershed Protection Division is the lead organization within the City responsible for investigating illegal dumping. However LAPD and BSS can also investigate illegal dumping in criminal and administrative capacities. \n\nThe City’s Capacity to Investigate Illegal Dumping is Insufficient\n\nIllegal dumping occurs when residents and businesses choose not to pay proper waste disposal fees, or fail to take their waste and bulky items to a registered disposal facility or dump. This could be a business owner who does not pay for a large enough dumpster and illegally dumps excess waste, or an unlicensed contractor who abandons demolition materials rather than take it to a facility that accepts construction waste. \n\nIllegally Dumped Waste in Los Angeles\n\nEvery time a person chooses to illegally dump waste, they are harming the community, and burdening taxpayers because the City must mobilize resources to collect the trash. This is why it is critically important that the City not only identify and cite violators, but deter people from turning City streets into disposal sites. \n\nInvestigation Responsibilities Were Recently Consolidated Under LASAN\n\nAlthough LASAN’s Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit is currently responsible for investigating illegal dumping, until recently there were two City departments taking a lead role in investigating illegal dumping. Up until 2019, the BSS Investigation and Enforcement Division, which investigates code violations and safety issues in the PROW, was the lead agency responsible for investigating LAMC 66.25 violations (prohibits dumping solid waste upon any street or in the Los Angeles River). \n\nHowever, in an effort to consolidate investigative activities under one bureau, BSS ceded this responsibility to LASAN, which investigates violations of LAMC 64.70.02 (prohibits dumping waste and hazardous liquids into the storm drain system), as well as State and federal environmental protection laws. BSS still investigates illegal dumping, but this typically occurs only when the illegal dumping is connected to a separate violation. \n\nAlthough LASAN and BSS have historically investigated different illegal dumping laws, it is important to note that any illegal dumping activity is a violation of LAMC 64.70.02 because all illegally dumped waste in the PROW impacts the City’s storm drain system. The LAPD can also cite individuals that illegally dump, but the organization has a formal agreement designating LASAN as the primary law enforcement authority for illegal dumping crimes. \n\nLASAN and BSS managers said the consolidation of illegal dumping investigations under LASAN allowed a single department with illegal dumping specialists to manage investigations and strategy, rather than having two departments investigating similar crimes due to overlapping responsibilities. \n\nLASAN’s Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit prioritized illegal dumping enforcement in 2019 after becoming the lead investigative agency, and in response to the increase of illegal dumping across the City. In 2019, the enforcement unit issued 205 criminal citations and written warnings for illegal dumping offenses, which was up from 30 in 2018. The enforcement unit reported that in 2019, it issued a total of 710 criminal citations and written warnings for the various stormwater and pollution laws it enforces. See Appendix D for a full breakdown of the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit’s 2019 enforcement metrics.\n\nHowever, as described below, the increase in enforcement operations initiated in 2019 is likely unsustainable due to staffing constraints and competing priorities within the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit. In the first half of 2020, Environmental Compliance Officers issued 21 criminal citations and written warnings.\n\nLASAN’s Staffing Model and Resources Do Not Meet Its Complex Role and Workload\n\nThe Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit’s duties are required by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System MS4 permit held by Los Angeles County. Investigating illegal dumping is one of several distinct responsibilities of the unit. In addition, the unit: \n\ninvestigates illicit discharges and leaks impacting the storm drain system and the Los Angeles River; \nconducts inspections at industrial and commercial facilities that store harmful or hazardous substances that pose public safety and watershed pollution risks; and\nacts as a first responder for hazardous materials spills and related incidents. \n\nThe Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit’s direct salary budget for FY 2020-21 is approximately $2.3 million, and the unit is authorized for a total of 28 Environmental Compliance Inspectors, at both senior and junior levels. However, due to hiring and staff retention issues, the unit has just 16 inspectors, four of which are on loan to the Livability Services Division to support encampment and illegal dumping cleanup operations. \n\nAccording to Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit managers, the unit’s 12 fully dedicated employees are too few to carry out the organization’s mission, and limits LASAN’s ability to investigate illegal dumping incidents and carry out undercover surveillance activities that aim to catch violators in the act. The unit is also struggling to carry out inspections of an estimated 90,000 businesses and facilities covered by the industrial and commercial facility inspection program. The MS4 permit that the City operates under requires LASAN to inspect these facilities two times every five years. \n\nEnvironmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit staffing limitations are further compounded by the fact that just five of the unit’s Environmental Compliance Inspectors are designated as Environmental Compliance Officers – sworn public officers with limited peace officer powers and the authority to conduct criminal investigations, issue citations, and make arrests. According to the unit’s managers, converting Environmental Compliance Inspectors to public officers presents challenges because employees are hired for investigative roles, but sometimes either fail to pass law enforcement background checks, or fail to complete their law enforcement training program. The division must then reassign the employee to a different role. \n\nThese challenges highlight shortcomings of the unit’s staffing model, which does not clearly reflect its multidisciplinary role. Changes are needed if the department is to effectively carry out all of its environmental protection duties. Specifically, LASAN should work with the City’s Personnel Department to develop a new, sworn public officer classification to improve the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit’s ability to hire and retain investigators. \n\nCertain organizational changes could also improve the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit’s investigative capacity and boost efficiency. LASAN should conduct a formal staffing needs assessment to determine how many Environmental Compliance Inspectors and Officers are needed to fully support the unit’s investigation, inspection, and emergency response mandates. It should also consider reorganizing the unit to create a section dedicated to emergency response and illegal dumping investigations, and a section dedicated to regulatory inspections of industrial and commercial facilities. \n\nIllegal Dumping Surveillance Camera Coverage is Limited \n\nInvestigating illegal dumping cases, and implementing surveillance operations with undercover Environmental Compliance Officers, is labor intensive and requires a large amount of staff time. Complicated investigations can be time consuming and lengthy, and require Environmental Compliance Officers to vet multiple leads, while undercover surveillance requires plainclothes and hidden officers to hide out to identify illegal dumping crimes in progress. \n\nBased on the staffing resources needed to investigate illegal dumping cases, Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit managers stressed the need for a strengthened illegal dumping surveillance camera program. The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, which manages the State’s waste management initiatives, has also emphasized the value of camera surveillance programs as an important enforcement tool. Specifically, cameras can: \n\nserve as a cost-effective, passive monitoring tool that requires less staffing resources than undercover operations; \ncollect evidence against violators that can be used to support criminal prosecutions, administrative citations, or the issuance of formal warnings; and \nprotect communities by deterring individuals from illegally dumping waste.\n\nThe Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit currently has just 19 surveillance cameras deployed across the City’s 470 square miles of land area, and estimated 6,500 miles of roadway. \n\nWhile cities’ use of surveillance cameras vary widely based on budget, privacy, and operational factors, some large cities have made cameras a central element of their illegal dumping programs. The City of Philadelphia, which manages approximately 2,200 miles of roadway, has deployed just over 100 illegal dumping cameras. The City of Phoenix, which manages approximately 4,900 miles of roadway, has deployed 26 cameras.\n\nGiven the staffing and cost implications of manned surveillance operations, LASAN should expand its surveillance camera network to cover additional illegal dumping hotspot areas. The number and location of additional cameras should be based on existing service request and investigations data. As with any expansion of video surveillance technology, the department should also ensure adequate privacy safeguards are in place to protect civil rights and liberties. \n\nImproving Interdepartmental Coordination and Planning\n\nGiven how difficult it is to deter illegal dumping, and identify individuals that are illegally dumping, the City could benefit from developing a coordinated illegal dumping enforcement strategy. The City does not currently have a comprehensive illegal dumping strategy or coordination mechanism, and while LASAN is the lead agency for illegal dumping mitigation programs, BSS, LAPD, and the City Attorney’s Office all play key supporting roles, highlighting the need for coordinated strategies and enforcement programs. \n\nThere are also opportunities for other City departments to enhance their role in combating illegal dumping. For example, the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) receives and investigates code compliance complaints for illicit construction activities, or projects that are otherwise not properly permitted. According to LADBS managers, unpermitted construction projects and work performed by unlicensed contractors are a source of illegally dumped construction waste. LADBS could support LASAN by referring cases involving unpermitted projects, unlicensed contractors, and unlicensed waste haulers to LASAN enforcement units for possible follow-up.  \n\nTo that end, the City should develop a working group that meets consistently to evaluate trends and develop enforcement programs. Specifically, a working group would develop strategies addressing the following: \n\nthe identification of illegal dumping root causes;\ncoordination of enforcement activities and case referrals;\ninformation and data sharing; and\nenhanced enforcement of waste hauling regulations to ensure businesses and residents properly dispose of waste. \n\nThe scope of illegal dumping represents a major challenge for the City, and it will require LASAN working in conjunction with multiple departments to enhance enforcement, and address the root causes. \n\nMore Aggressive Administrative Citation Fines \n\nIllegal dumping fines for criminal citations, as established in the Municipal Code, carry maximum financial penalties of $250 for infractions and $1,000 for misdemeanors. These fine levels may not be sufficient given the impact illegal dumping is having on Angelenos. While fine levels in the LAMC for criminal citations, which are processed by the courts, are generally restricted to current levels by State laws and the Municipal Code, the City’s ACE program may offer more flexibility. \n\nAccording to the City Attorney’s Office, ACE program administrative citations for certain lower level offenses are an important enforcement tool, and an effective alternative to criminal citations. Currently only BSS and LAPD issue administrative citations for illegal dumping offenses. However, the City Council is considering a motion that would allow LASAN staff in enforcement and compliance roles to issue administrative citations and participate in the ACE program.\n\nGiven the impact illegal dumping has on both the environment and local communities, the City should consider increasing administrative fine amounts in order to deter would-be violators, and assess a fine that reflects the seriousness of the violation. In evaluating whether to increase administrative penalties for LAMC 64.70.02 and 66.25 violations, City officials should consider the fine levels established by the State’s Penal Code.\n\nAccording to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, local jurisdictions in the State are finding that administrative citations are an effective mechanism for administering penalties and obtaining timely monetary settlements. The Sacramento County Code authorizes administrative citation fines in line with California Penal Code Section 374.3 – $1,000 for the first citation, $1,500 for the second citation, and $3,000 for the third citation. \n\nRecommendations\n\nTo improve the City’s ability to investigate illegal dumping cases and hold violators accountable, LASAN should:\n\nConsider reorganizing the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit. The reorganization should include dedicated units for (1) illegal dumping investigations and other environmental enforcement activities and (2) MS4 industrial and commercial facility inspections.\nCreate a dedicated, sworn public officer classification for Environmental Compliance Officer positions to improve recruitment and retention.\nExpand the illegal dumping surveillance camera program to ensure additional coverage of illegal dumping hotspots.\n\nTo enhance coordination among departments and allow for the development of a comprehensive illegal dumping mitigation strategy, LASAN, BSS, LAPD, and other City departments involved in illegal dumping enforcement should:\n\nEstablish an interdepartmental working group or task force to identify and share trends, coordinate illegal dumping enforcement activities, and develop strategies.\n\nTo determine whether penalties for illegal dumping are consistent with the severity of the violation, the City Council should: \n\nRequest that the City Attorney’s Office, in conjunction with LASAN, report to the Council with options for increasing administrative citation fines for illegal dumping violations, and an assessment of whether the fines should reflect illegal dumping fine amounts established under State law. \nPREVENTING ILLEGAL DUMPING\n\nOn any given day, LASAN crews collect a wide variety of trash and debris from public spaces. Generally, illegally dumped waste is generated by businesses and residents that choose not to maintain a sufficient level of trash service, and those who fail to take large quantities of waste, debris, and junk to a registered dump or recycling center. Unlicensed junk haulers and construction projects also play a role in the accumulation of waste on City streets.  \n\nLASAN conducts quarterly assessments of all of the City’s streets and alleyways as part of its CleanStat program, which collects data on the cleanliness of City streets that can be used to evaluate sanitation conditions over time, and aid in resource planning and strategy development. CleanStat data indicates the most common illegally dumped waste is bulky items, such as furniture, mattresses, and household appliances. However, data also shows that a large amount of general trash and loose debris is dumped in the PROW, as well as waste associated with construction projects. \n\nThe chart below shows the most common types of illegally dumped waste, based on CleanStat data from July 2019, when LASAN began collecting data on the types of waste dumped on City streets, through March 2020, when the department temporarily suspended cleanliness assessments. The information reflected in the chart is based on observed illegal dumping incidents, and does not factor volume or weight.\n\nWhile enhancing LASAN’s illegal dumping investigations and enforcement programs will be central in eliminating the accumulation of waste in public spaces, the City should also consider taking certain proactive steps to eliminate illegal dumping root causes, and advise residents and businesses of their responsibilities with regard to keeping Los Angeles clean and safe. \n\nImprove Public Awareness and Encourage the Use of the City’s Free and Low-Cost Services\n\nImproving public awareness about illegal dumping and its impact on the community is an important element of illegal dumping mitigation programs. Specifically, the City could benefit from a concerted and coordinated public awareness campaign that accomplishes the following: \n\neducates the general public on the harmful impacts of illegal dumping and the need to properly dispose of business and household waste;\nnotifies illegal dumpers they are committing a crime and face punishment when caught; and\nencourages people to report illegal dumping and provide crime tips.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, any City campaign would need to make Angelenos aware of free and low-cost options for disposing of excess waste and bulky items. LASAN offers residents several services in the event they have extra waste, bulky items, or hazardous waste in need of disposal. The services and sites listed below are examples of services available to City residents.\n\nCentral Los Angeles Recycling and Transfer Station (CLARTS) – CLARTS is a waste transfer center open to commercial businesses and the general public. The cost to dispose of waste is $70 per ton, or $80 per ton for hard to handle bulky items. \nS.A.F.E. Centers – S.A.F.E Centers are sites where residents can dispose of household hazardous waste, such as electronic equipment, paint, cleaners and solvents, and used oil, at no cost. Some small businesses may also drop off hazardous waste, for a fee.  \nFree Bulky Item Collection – LASAN collects at no additional charge bulky household items such as mattresses, couches, doors, carpet, toilets, electrical waste, and other furniture from residents in single and multifamily housing units that are serviced by LASAN.\nExtra Capacity Tags – In the event a household has more trash than can fit in their LASAN-issued trash can, customers can purchase extra capacity tags. Customers can simply attach the tag to their extra bag or bags of trash. The tags are $2 each.\n\nThere are several different ways that the City could reach residents and business owners. For example, City agencies can communicate illegal dumping messages via existing social media platforms, email, websites, utility bills, and through traditional broadcast channels like radio and television public service announcements. The City could also expand signage in the PROW to deter dumping violations and advertise reporting options. \n\nThe California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery best management practices for illegal dumping stress the need for effective outreach campaigns because they improve the success of enforcement programs and help address certain root causes. For example, the City of Oakland launched in January 2020 a new campaign called Oaktown PROUD – Prevent and Report Our Unlawful Dumping. This program aims to educate residents about the right way to dispose of trash, encourage people to report illegal dumping, and involve members of the community. The campaign also includes a student ambassador program, where young people conduct outreach activities and educate peers.\n\nConsider New Solid Waste Disposal Options for Residents\n\nThough the City offers residents several free and low-cost opportunities to dispose of waste, the City may need to explore new ways to help residents legally dispose of household solid waste and junk. Developing new avenues that make it easier to dispose of unneeded items and trash reduces the likelihood that a person will resort to abandoning waste in public spaces. \n\nFor example, some local jurisdictions periodically offer community dumpster days, where a city or county will schedule neighborhood cleanup days in advance and provide dumpsters so that residents can gather and get rid of unneeded items and waste. Other jurisdictions will offer free dump days, or vouchers that allow certain residents to discard solid household waste at a dump, at no cost. Los Angeles County implemented a free landfill voucher program in the Antelope Valley, an area in the county’s northern region, which for years has been impacted by chronic illegal dumping. \n\nDeveloping programs such as these may result in less illegal dumping, especially if they are specifically offered in neighborhoods where the illegal dumping of household waste and bulky items is common.  \n\nProactive Inspections for LASAN’s Commercial Customers \n\nFor commercial customers and certain multifamily residential customers, the City operates an exclusive franchise hauling system known as recycLA. Under this system, the City is divided into 11 zones, and recycLA customers in each zone are exclusively serviced by an assigned franchise service provider. LAMC Section 66.03 requires all businesses, commercial establishments, and multifamily dwellings in the City to subscribe to waste collection services. Those customers must ensure they carry an adequate minimum level of service based on the amount of waste generated at the location. LAMC Section 66.17.1 also requires customers to be able to furnish proof of service.   \n\nBusinesses and other organizations that do not have an adequate level of trash service are more likely to illegally dispose of waste. These organizations might choose to illegally dump waste to avoid fees imposed by franchise service providers when a site generates more trash than there is capacity for, or to avoid paying for additional levels of trash service.  \n\nRecycLA Inspectors from LASAN’s Solid Resources Commercial Franchise Division are responsible for evaluating both customers’ compliance with City waste management regulations, and franchise service providers’ compliance with City regulations and franchise agreements. Issues inspectors will evaluate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nlevels and frequency of service needed for a site;\nbin size and capacity needs;\nopportunities for recycling;\nadequacy of service provided by franchise waste haulers; and\ncustomer billing disputes.\n\nEvaluations of customers’ waste service levels are a useful tool for ensuring businesses have adequate trash capacity and service, thereby reducing the likelihood businesses will resort to improperly disposing of trash and debris. Since the establishment of its enforcement program in May 2018, through December 2020, the Solid Resources Commercial Franchise Division has identified a total of 1,487 addresses that may not be compliant with recycLA regulations. These sites have been identified through canvassing efforts, and through referrals from recycLA service providers, customers, members of the public, and community organizations such as Business Improvement Districts. Inspectors have completed 1,384 site inspections and found that 661 sites (48 percent) should have been subscribed to recycLA services but were not, or were otherwise not in compliance with the City’s commercial waste hauling requirements. \n\nTo reduce the likelihood businesses will resort to illegal dumping, LASAN should expand its inspections program and develop a formal, proactive waste assessment program to evaluate commercial customers’ compliance with LAMC Sections 66.03 and 66.17.1, as well as other applicable waste regulations. A proactive evaluation program should focus on geographic areas impacted by businesses waste, and business sectors generating the types of waste commonly dumped on City streets and alleyways. \n\nAccording to Solid Resources Commercial Franchise Division managers, the recycLA inspections group has preliminary plans to increase the number of proactive, routine inspections it conducts, but is currently limited by staffing constraints. The unit is currently staffed by 32 inspectors, and there are 14 vacancies. These inspectors are responsible for nearly 64,000 accounts. \n\nThe establishment of a proactive inspections program would also be timely, as the City Council is currently considering a motion that would allow recycLA inspectors to issue administrative citations to those customers that fail to maintain adequate levels of trash service.\n\nExpanding Oversight of Construction and Demolition Waste \n\nAlthough it is not the most common type of illegally dumped waste, LASAN commonly encounters waste associated with construction projects. Consistent with requirements established by the California Integrated Waste Management Act, LAMC Section 66.32 requires construction and demolition waste haulers, including construction services that haul their own waste, to maintain a valid, LASAN-issued Solid Waste Hauler Permit. Permitted haulers must also transport construction waste to a certified construction and demolition waste processing facility. \n\nLADBS is the City’s lead department for enforcing ordinances and laws related to the construction, alteration, repair, demolition, and removal of buildings and structures. While the department does not play a central role in waste management enforcement, it does verify that construction companies and other firms properly dispose of construction and demolition waste for projects subject to the Los Angeles Green Building Code. \n\nThe Los Angeles Green Building Code, which is based on the State mandated California Green Building Code, was developed to achieve consistent green building standards across California jurisdictions. The Los Angeles Green Building Code aims to reduce buildings’ energy and water use, waste accumulation, and carbon footprints. The following projects are subject to the code’s requirements: \n\nall new buildings (residential and non-residential);\nall additions (residential and non-residential);\nalterations with building valuations of $200,000 or more (residential and non-residential); and \nresidential alterations that increase a building’s conditioned volume.\n\nFor projects subject to the Los Angeles Green Building Code, permit applicants must submit to LADBS a waste management plan and list the certified waste hauler to be used. LADBS staff later verify waste hauling documentation during the inspection process. \n\nLADBS should consider whether to expand its verification of waste hauling documentation beyond projects subject to the Los Angeles Green Building Code in order to verify that construction and demolition waste associated with smaller projects is taken to a certified processing facility. While it may not be feasible or efficient to evaluate all building alterations, the department, in conjunction with LASAN, should examine if additional project types should undergo waste hauling verification by LADBS staff.  \n\nRecommendations \n\nTo reduce the likelihood that individuals will resort to illegally dumping waste, LASAN should:\n\nDevelop a public awareness campaign to educate the public about illegal dumping laws, fines and punishments, and available free and low-cost waste disposal services offered by the City.\nEvaluate the feasibility of new, community-based solid waste collection initiatives, such as dumpster days or landfill voucher programs, in areas heavily impacted by illegal dumping. \nExpedite the development of a proactive waste management inspection program for commercial (recycLA) customers to ensure sites are maintaining an appropriate level of waste services.\n\nTo reduce the amount of construction related waste dumped in the PROW, the City Council should:\n\nInstruct LADBS to report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of expanding construction and demolition waste hauling verification to smaller projects not currently covered by the Los Angeles Green Building Code.\nFUNDING ILLEGAL DUMPING MITIGATION PROGRAMS\n\nThe City should consider new, sustainable funding solutions that allow LASAN to expand and maintain its illegal dumping mitigation and response programs. Specifically, new revenue may be needed to develop a robust investigation and enforcement program, and to ramp up federally-mandated MS4 inspections at industrial facilities. New funds may also be needed to support the expansion of illegal dumping response crews. Though LASAN should first complete formal staffing and equipment needs assessments, policymakers should specifically consider two revenue sources to support future watershed protection activities. \n\nStormwater Pollution Abatement Charge \n\nThe main funding source for LASAN’s stormwater protection and water quality programs, including the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit, is the Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund. The primary revenue source of the fund is the Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge (SPAC) fee, which is assessed on each parcel in the City for the receiving, transporting, pumping, treatment, and disposal of storm drainage through the storm drain system. \n\nWhile the SPAC fee varies by parcel, it is assessed with a base charge of $23 per Equivalent Dwelling Unit. This fee has not been adjusted since 1993–nearly 30 years ago–despite LASAN facing increasing operating costs and investment needs within its stormwater management program. Adjusting only for inflation, the base charge established in 1993 has a 2021 dollar value of $41, based on U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. \n\nSome new revenue streams supporting stormwater pollution control programs have become available since 1993. In 2004, City residents approved Proposition O, which authorized up $500 million of general obligation bonds for City of Los Angeles projects that prevent and remove pollutants from our regional waterways and the ocean. In 2018, Los Angeles County residents approved Measure W to establish a parcel tax of 2.5¢ per square foot of impermeable area. A portion of that revenue is set aside for local municipalities, including the City of Los Angeles. \n\nHowever, Proposition O and Measure W funds primarily support infrastructure projects as opposed to enforcement operations. The City is also expected to receive less Measure W revenue than expected, due in part to the impacts of COVID-19. To ensure the SPAC fee revenues are sufficient to cover costs associated with LASAN’s pollution control, enforcement, and education activities, the City needs to examine whether to adjust the fee.\n\nEstablishment of an MS4 Inspection Fee    \n\nWhen carrying out inspections of industrial and commercial facilities, Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit staff are conducting a necessary environmental protection activity required by Los Angeles County’s federal MS4 permit. Currently, LASAN does not impose a fee for MS4 inspections to help cover the cost of the inspection services, which means the unit’s limited resources must cover illegal dumping enforcement, and regulatory inspection operations. \n\nWithout an inspection fee, or re-inspection fee for businesses that require a second review, LASAN’s enforcement unit will struggle to identify the resources needed to conduct MS4 inspections. Based on the MS4 permit requirement that the City inspect approximately 90,000 businesses twice within a five year period, LASAN should be inspecting approximately 36,000 each year. \n\nInspection fees are not uncommon in the City, as City departments typically assess fees for inspections and other municipal services in order to recover costs. For example the:\n\nDepartment of Building and Safety charges fees for building permit reviews and inspections;\nFire Department charges fees for building plan reviews and fire inspections; and \nHousing and Community Investment Department charges fees for its residential rental property inspection program.\n\nCity officials and Policymakers have considered developing an MS4 inspection fee program in the past, but no fee has ever been implemented. The City should revisit the need for a new inspection fee, which could provide a sustainable funding source for the environmental inspection mission of LASAN’s watershed protection program. \n\nRecommendations \n\nTo determine whether the City’s illegal dumping enforcement and abatement programs have sufficient and sustainable resources, the City Council should: \n\nInstruct LASAN to report to the Council to provide a formal staffing, operational, and equipment needs assessment for the department’s enforcement unit, and the adequacy of current funding levels. \nInstruct LASAN to, with assistance from the City Attorney’s Office, report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of increasing the Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge.\nInstruct LASAN to, with assistance from the City Attorney’s Office, report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of establishing an inspection fee for federally-mandated commercial facility inspections to help recover the cost of inspection services.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe City’s streets, sidewalks, and alleyways are such an essential part of day-to-day life in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, too many communities are impacted by the blight and hazards caused by illegal dumping. By implementing the strategies proposed in this report, the City can be more aggressive with its cleanup response and enforcement programs, and begin to address illegal dumping root causes so that less trash ends up in the PROW. Doing so will help hold illegal dumpers accountable, and ensure the water that drains into the storm drain system is cleaner and safer for the environment.   \n\nRECOMMENDATION TABLE\nNumber\tRecommendation\nResponsible Entity: City Council\n6\tRequest that the City Attorney’s Office, in conjunction with LASAN, report to the Council with options for increasing administrative citation fines for illegal dumping violations, and an assessment of whether the fines should reflect illegal dumping fine amounts established under State law.\n10\tInstruct LADBS to report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of expanding construction and demolition waste hauling verification to smaller projects not currently covered by the Los Angeles Green Building Code.\n11\tInstruct LASAN to report to the Council to provide a formal staffing, operational, and equipment needs assessment for the department’s enforcement unit, and the adequacy of current funding levels.\n12\tInstruct LASAN to, with assistance from the City Attorney’s Office, report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of increasing the Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge.\n13\tInstruct LASAN to, with assistance from the City Attorney’s Office, report to the Council with an assessment on the feasibility of establishing an inspection fee for federally-mandated commercial facility inspections to help recover the cost of inspection services.\nResponsible Entity: LASAN\n1\tAssess the feasibility of implementing new, dedicated illegal dumping cleanup crews, and explore the use of Stormwater Pollution Abatement Fund monies or other special funds to support the establishment of new crews.\n2\tConsider reorganizing the Environmental Enforcement and Emergency Response Unit.

Its goal was to be a one-stop shop for non-emergency service requests, removing the need to navigate through dozens of individual departmental directories in order to get graffiti erased, street lights fixed, potholes filled, bulky items removed and much more. As a service organization, City leaders saw the need to take steps to achieve a superior level of customer service. By some measures, those efforts have borne fruit as system usage continues to rise. In 2020, 311 fielded a total of 1.75 million service requests and is getting more information-only requests than ever before.\n\nBut over nearly two decades, customer contact methods have matured beyond simple phone calls to multiple, integrated ways of communicating, such as via email, social media, web portal and smartphone app. Charged with operating Los Angeles’ 311 call center and its customer relationship management (CRM) system, the Information Technology Agency (ITA) has worked to improve 311 over the years to keep up with industry norms. ITA developed the 311 mobile app and website to help residents submit service requests on the fly, which jointly accounted for 80% of 311’s service requests in 2020, a pronounced uptick from 51% in 2016.\n\nDespite the enhancements to 311, my current report illustrates that the program is not working as efficiently as it could; nor is it keeping up with the level of customer service provided by other large cities. Los Angeles should do more to foster collaboration between departments and adopt a forward-thinking model that prioritizes a better overall customer experience.\n\nCustomer-first approach \n\nUndercutting its billing as a one-stop shop for neighborhood services is the City’s fragmented approach to service requests. Many departments still utilize their own contact channels to accept and resolve basic service requests. For example, the Bureau of Sanitation’s own call center received more than 700,000 bulky item pickup, dead animal removal and other requests in 2020 — all of which could have been handled through 311. In some cases, 311 does not include routine service requests that should be available in the system, such as reporting parking violations and filing noise complaints. And 311 gets numerous requests that require specialized assistance beyond the program’s scope, which would be better fielded by the departments themselves. All of this causes confusion, increases wait times — a lingering problem — and undermines 311’s mission.\n\nIn addition, unlike the practice of other large U.S. cities, 311 in Los Angeles does not give customers estimated completion times for most service requests and cannot force departments to work with it to do so, leaving transparency and accountability by the wayside. Chicago employs a map to allow customers to view the status of recent service requests on its 311 website and app — something Los Angeles should consider to better illustrate how the City is serving them. L.A.’s 311 paradigm also fails to proactively seek customer feedback that could help departments address service delivery and request fulfillment problems.\n\nImprovements for the future\n\nNearly two decades after creating the 311 call center, the City must look ahead to the next 20 years and strive to create a new plan that overhauls how the City engages with Angelenos to meet their evolving communication and customer service needs. Doing so will require overcoming institutional resistance from departments to work cooperatively and closely with 311 and achieve what other cities have. My report recommends that City policy makers should:\n\nInstruct ITA, with the assistance of other departments, to prepare a citywide customer contact strategy that re-evaluates how the City engages with its residents and the role of 311 and other department call centers. This would include a plan to centralize routine service requests with 311, migrate complex requests frequently transferred by 311 back to departments to handle first, communicate estimated service completion times to customers, solicit feedback and increase community engagement efforts to raise awareness of 311.\n\nAdditionally, as ITA has acknowledged, it will be necessary to replace the current 311 CRM system with a more flexible, capable and cost-effective system. When the City is financially able and willing to move forward, the department needs to contemplate and incorporate new business practices and technologies to ensure long-term success.\n\nITA should include customer ideas into the design process, use new technologies like artificial intelligence to improve self-service and reduce program costs, and create an omnichannel contact center environment to integrate all the different ways customers currently use 311. Such an environment would build customer profiles based on their previous interaction history across various contact methods.\n\nAs with other City programs, the COVID-19 pandemic put extra stress on 311 with an increased volume of contacts, further highlighting the need for an improved system. I urge City leaders to adopt a strategy that puts customers first and suits Angelenos’ needs now and in the decades to come.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFrom trash pickup to pothole repairs, residents rely on their local government to provide services that improve their community, and often turn to 311 to find this information and request services. After the 311 call center was established in 2002, the customer contact industry in general has matured from a focus on call centers to a more complex contact center environment offering multiple, integrated contact channels that allow customers to move seamlessly from one contact method to another.\n\nAs the City’s lead agency for 311, the Information Technology Agency (ITA) operates the 311 call center and its customer relationship management (CRM) system for managing service requests. ITA also developed the 311 mobile app and website as self-service options, which account for 39% of service requests submitted through all departmental contact channels in 2020. Moreover, the mobile app and website account for 80% service requests received through contact channels operated by 311.\n\nHowever, 311’s ability to improve customer service in Los Angeles has fallen behind similar programs in other cities. Overall, we found that the City could do more to improve inter-departmental collaboration to adopt a more customer-centric model for providing services.\n\n311’s Incomplete Customer Service Strategy Limits Its Value\n\nAlthough 311 can process many types of service requests, it competes with several other departments—which continue to maintain their own contact channels to receive and resolve routine service requests. 311 also receives many calls for the Departments of Building and Safety and Animal Services requiring specialized assistance that it cannot handle, negatively impacting its customer service value. Los Angeles’ fragmented approach for requests impairs 311’s model as a one-stop shop for the most common needs coming from its residents. Going forward, the City should consider migrating call types for complex or specialized requests back to other departments, and moving more routine requests onto 311.\n\nIn addition, 311 and other departments do not provide estimated completion times for most service requests types. By contrast, 311 programs in several other cities consider estimated service times essential to their commitment for transparency and accountability. 311 could also enhance services in the City by proactively obtaining end-to-end feedback to help other departments identify and address systemic issues with service fulfillment.\n\nRevamping 311 Going Forward\n\nNearly 20 years after launching the 311 call center in 2002, the gap between its partial successes and the City’s overall ambitions for improving customer service highlight the need to catch up with our peers while planning ahead for the future. Standing in 311’s way is the City’s culture of autonomous departments, who naturally want to own the processes, data, and resources for the services they provide. Overcoming this challenge now requires a new plan that re-evaluates and transforms how the City engages with Angelenos to meet their needs.\n\nFocusing on Requests Where 311 Can Deliver the Most Value – 311 is best suited for processing high volume, low complexity service requests, especially through its mobile app. ITA and other departments should develop a migration plan and customer service strategy to move more routine requests to 311 for processing, create even more types of service requests that are currently not available through 311, and divert callers away from 311 for services that it is not equipped to handle. In particular, expanding the number of services available through 311 would empower Angelenos with more convenient self-service options.\n\nInvesting in Community Engagement and Expanding Access – The City has taken a sporadic, patchwork approach to marketing and outreach for 311. To match other cities who have dedicated resources to increase public awareness of its services, 311 should develop a community engagement plan to increase its outreach, expand access, and increase usability.\n\nMeasuring Service Performance and Collecting Customer Feedback – Bringing the City up to speed with providing estimated completion times for service requests will require 311 and other departments to develop protocols for establishing, communicating, and reviewing time- bound goals for as many service requests as possible. 311 should also proactively survey the City’s customers, after a request has been closed, and ask them to rate the quality of services.\n\nLessons Learned from the 311 CRM System Project– Five years after going live in January 2016, ITA and other departments have already acknowledged the need to replace the 311 CRM system due to a variety of issues. If the City moves forward with a replacement project, ITA should adopt lessons learned from its implementation of the current system to ensure a more successful project delivery. These include a comprehensive evaluation of proposed IT solutions, better project planning and contract management to minimize delays and cost increases, and hiring consultants to provide independent assessments of project deliverables and risks.\n\nAdditional Lessons For the Future\n\nWhile many of the recommendations above would put the City on par with other 311 programs, policymakers should also consider incorporating new business practices and technologies in its strategic planning process to shape 311 for the next 20 years.\n\nAs part a growing user experience movement to improve digital services in government, the City should incorporate user-centered design to improve the usability and ease-of-use of the 311 mobile app and website. San Antonio, Dallas, and Chicago each developed a customer engagement process to gather public input and improve its 311 digital products.\n\nAlthough still a nascent technology, the contact center industry has found several applications for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve self-service for customers and reduce costs. From AI-powered recommendations to select the right service request, to chatbots and virtual agents, new contact center technologies are increasingly capable improving self-service options, and should be explored by the City and 311 in the future.\n\n311 already offers multiple contact channels through its call center, website, and mobile app, and in the future may add more options such as virtual agent self-service and chatbots. But to create an effective customer experience, the City should consider how it can integrate these different channels to create an omnichannel environment that allows customers to seamlessly move from one touchpoint to the next.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCities and counties provide a vast array of services that residents rely on every day. Beyond public safety services provided by police and fire departments, local governments in general are expected to pick up trash, fill potholes, enforce municipal ordinances, and provide a host of other basic services to maintain and improve the quality of life in their jurisdiction.\n\nAs voters and taxpayers, residents have a right to voice their concerns to local government and influence the types of services provided. By speaking with their elected officials or reporting a specific issue directly to a department, engaged residents help make their communities a better place to live. However, constituents unfamiliar with the maze of bureaucracy may have a difficult time finding the right agency to request a service. Local governments throughout the country created 311 programs to address this problem.\n\nFrom its inception in the late 1990s, the immediate goal of City policymakers was to establish a 311 call center. However, the widespread adoption of the internet also presented an emerging opportunity. To ensure that the City could evolve to match constituent preferences and meet residents where they were at, policymakers also made “e-government” a goal for its 311 initiative to make information and services available online. Later innovations in consumer mobile technologies also paved the way for a 311 smartphone application.\n\nOverall, City policymakers envisioned 311 as a citywide solution for improving customer service. They believed that 311 should provide Angelenos a convenient, prompt, and reliable way to access accurate information about the City, and request non-emergency services, through a single contact center that could handle requests from the public through their channel of choice: be it telephone or online.\n\nSince then, the customer contact industry has matured from a focus on call centers to a more complex contact center environment offering multiple, integrated contact channels that allows customers to move seamlessly from one contact method to another. According to a study by ContactBabel, a consultancy specializing in the contact center industry, live agent calls in the private sector, as a proportion of all contacts, is projected to decline from 76% in 2007 to 64% in 2021. In its place, other contact channels have grown, especially self-service, email, web chat, and social media. Going forward, the ability to handle different channels in an effective and integrated manner will be vital.\n\nThe Controller’s Office reviewed the performance of the 311 program in 2014 and found that it operated more like a switchboard operator, with a high rate of call transfers, than a streamlined one-stop customer service center. Although 311 has made progress since then, we found that the City could still do much more to improve inter-departmental collaboration and adopt a more customer-centric model for providing services.\n\n311 and the Information Technology Agency\n\nLike 311 in other cities, Los Angeles’ strategy was to create a central point of contact for the public to access non-emergency services and general information. Policymakers envisioned the City’s fragmented departmental interactions with the public giving way to an integrated and convenient constituent experience. The City’s plan for realizing that vision comprised of:\n\nforming a citywide 311 call center;\nconsolidating all call centers across the city into 311;\ncreating a citywide system for managing service requests; and\nadding self-service features enabled by new online technologies.\n\nThe goal behind each step was to improve customer service in various ways. Forming 311 and consolidating call centers would solve the sometimes confusing task of making routine requests with the correct entity in the City. Creating a citywide service request system with online self-service features would make it easier to submit, track, and monitor the delivery of services.\n\nAs the lead department for 311, the Information Technology Agency (ITA) operates the City’s 311 call center. ITA also works with a contractor to oversee the implementation, maintenance, and support of 311’s customer relationship management (CRM) system, which is used to manage service requests, host a database of general information articles about the City, and support the 311 website and mobile app for the general public.\n\nAccording to its strategic plan for 2019 to 2021, 311 factors heavily in ITA’s desire to pivot towards services that directly impact the public. Given technology’s pervasiveness in society, ITA believed that it had the opportunity to extend its reach and benefit the public directly in a wider variety of areas. As an external customer-facing organization, 311 and ITA’s success therefore relies on its ability to understand and give voice to the needs and evolving preferences of Angelenos.\n\nBut beyond 311 and other services that it operates directly for the public, ITA’s main focus as an internal service organization is to support the IT needs of other departments in the City. Under this organizational framework, and without direct instructions and oversight from City policymakers, other departments can choose whether or not to work with ITA. 311’s success therefore also relies on ITA’s ability to influence other departments to work collaboratively with 311 to manage and fulfill service requests to meet the needs of the public.\n\nInformation and Services Available through 311\n\nITA maintains the 311 website and mobile app as alternative contact channels to the 311 telephone number. Angelenos can use the 311 website and app to access a directory of over 1,200 articles to learn more about City services. In addition, residents can use the website and mobile app to submit service requests on their own. Alternatively, Angelenos can also call 311 to speak with a live agent and request the same information and services that are available online.\n\nRequests submitted to 311 are entered into the 311 CRM system and automatically forwarded to the appropriate department for fulfillment. Departments with work order management systems integrated with the 311 CRM system also provide updates on the status of service requests. Over 60 types of services are currently available for request through 311.\n\nFor certain requests not yet integrated with the 311 CRM system, such as abandoned vehicle reports for LADOT, 311 agents can also help callers submit a request through the department’s website. However, not all types of service requests in the City can be requested through 311. Instead, 311 agents will transfer callers to other parts of the City for services that other departments have not made available online, or are not integrated with the 311 CRM system. For example, 311 must transfer callers to the Housing and Community Investment Department to handle complaints against landlords for substandard living conditions.\n\nFurther, referrals for health, housing, food, employment assistance, and other social services are generally not available through 311. Instead, residents can call 211 to get information and referrals for these services provided by Los Angeles County and other organizations within the County. 211 in Los Angeles is operated by an independent nonprofit organization and funded by grants and contracts from the County and other entities.\n\nThe Importance of Online and Mobile Contact Channels Has Grown\n\nIn 2020, 1.75 million service requests were created in the 311 CRM system. Call centers across the City, including those separately operated by 311 and the Bureau of Sanitation, generated half of these service requests. At the same time, the number of information only requests from callers to 311 has also increased significantly.\n\nHowever, service requests submitted online, particularly through 311’s self-service mobile app and website, have increased significantly between 2016 and 2020. When compared to all contact channels operated by different departments across the City, the 311 mobile app and website alone accounted for 39% of requests submitted in 2020. When focusing on just contact channels operated by 311, requests through the mobile app and website make up 80% of requests submitted.\n\nUsers can take advantage of their smartphone to take and upload photographs of the issue they are reporting. They can also determine the location through their phone’s GPS instead of having to type an address. In addition, the 311 mobile app and website can notify users about potentially duplicate service requests that have already been submitted at the same or nearby locations. By creating a MyLA311 account, users can also receive notifications and track the progress of requests they have submitted.\n\n311 also processes service requests it receives through email, voicemail, and other mediums. Although not significant in number, service requests through Twitter represent 311’s attempt to expand its contact channels to include social media platforms.\n\n311 During the Covid-19 Pandemic Response\n\nAs with other parts of the City, COVID-19 has presented a number of challenges for 311. Most notably, calls to 311 increased in conjunction with several surges of reported COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles. To address the pandemic information gap, the City deployed disaster service workers to assist with COVID-19 calls. However, average wait times for 311 still increased significantly in March, June, and December 2020.\n\nAlthough 311 faced staff shortages throughout the pandemic, they were relatively prepared to work from home when the Mayor issued the Safer-At-Home order in March 2020. Beginning in 2019, ITA piloted telework as a mobile workforce management strategy for 311 call agents, replacing desktop computers with laptops, and telephone lines with smartphones. 311’s call center management system was also available in the cloud, allowing agents to connect with callers and managers to monitor staff from anywhere, as long as they had an internet connection.\n\nCustomer Service Programs in other Cities\n\nBeginning in Baltimore in 1996, other local governments throughout the country established 311 call centers, to provide information and receive service requests. Over time, the vision for 311, in Los Angeles and elsewhere, expanded to include measuring performance and collecting constituent feedback on services provided by departments. By doing so, 311 programs can improve overall customer service by increasing transparency and accountability.\n\nThe following cities were chosen as peers to Los Angeles based on comparable population sizes, scale of operations, and their responsiveness to annual surveys from 2017 to 2020 conducted by CS Week 311, an industry group for 311 programs throughout the country.\n\nThe following section details the current condition of the City’s 311 program. Later in this report, we discuss how improvements in these areas should be part of a larger effort to reevaluate 311’s role for improving customer service throughout the City.\n\n311’S INCOMPLETE CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY\n\nWhen compared to the City’s original plan for 311, it has achieved some successes. Among those, the City can count establishing the 311 call center, implementing the CRM system for managing service requests, and creating self-service options through the 311 website and mobile app. Now that 311 offers multiple channels for receiving service requests through its mobile app, call center, and website, the opportunities for increasing resident access and participation are even greater.\n\nHowever, after the City did not follow through with call center consolidation, it did not develop an alternative plan to direct the most common requests through 311 to process. Meanwhile, ITA’s lack of authority also prevents it from providing estimated time frames to complete a request and collecting customer feedback in ways that would improve the services of other departments. The combined effects of this incomplete strategy significantly diminish 311’s potential benefits.\n\nMany Common Service Requests in the City Are Not Routed Through 311\n\n311 delivers its greatest value when it effectively and efficiently acts as the service requests entry point for other departments. This is true for issues like reports of street light outages and graffiti, where 96% and 99% of requests flow through 311, of which more than 82% came through the self-service website and mobile app.\n\nHowever, the City has not effectively routed to 311 as many routine requests as possible that are within its general scope. For example, Sanitation’s call center befittingly provides special account services to its billed customers for trash services. Despite this, Sanitation’s call center also received 702,524 requests in 2020 for bulky item pickups, dead animal removal, and others, comprising 52% of the service requests it handled that year. All of these service request types could have been handled through 311 instead. In 2020, 311 processed 33% of Sanitation’s service requests, the majority of which were through its mobile app and website.\n\nIn other cases, many services in Los Angeles cannot be requested through the 311 mobile app or website. Instead, Angelenos can try to call 311 for assistance, or use contact channels created by other departments to report issues—such as reports of parking violations and abandoned vehicles, fire safety issues, and noise complaints—because those departments have not integrated their service requests with 311.\n\n311 programs in other cities had consolidated more service request types, allowing residents to submit the request types listed above through their channel of choice. Los Angeles’ approach for handling routine requests—overlapping in some cases, while siloed in others—impairs 311’s model as a one-stop shop for the most common needs coming from its residents.\n\n311 Does Not Provide Estimated Completion Times for Most Request Types\n\nThe City’s original plan for 311 also envisioned providing constituents with the estimated time to complete service requests. However, 311 and other departments still have not implemented what should be a standard approach across all applicable types of service requests. Although the 311 director agrees that estimated service times should be provided, several departments we spoke to were hesitant to provide estimated completion times, and were concerned that doing so would create unreasonable expectations from the public.\n\nBy contrast, most 311 programs in other cities considered estimated completion times as an essential component of their city’s service commitment. Departments in other cities were responsible for establishing estimated completion times, while 311 was responsible for communicating that to the public. 311 programs in other cities believed that estimated completion times help to set reasonable expectations while creating more accountability.\n\nOther cities also use estimated completion times as way to monitor performance. Routing requests through 311 means that its receipt and closure are recorded in one system, rather than many systems belonging to different departments. Comparing estimated to actual completion times using the 311 CRM system’s database of requests would offer a powerful performance measurement tool for managers and policymakers alike. 311 in New York City, San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, and Philadelphia all reported using estimated service times as a benchmark for measuring the timeliness of service performance.\n\nIn a customer-driven business world of real-time status updates and 2-day delivery promises, providing estimated service times should be a common practice for services requested through 311 in Los Angeles. However, managing the reluctance by some departments to provide estimated service times is outside of 311’s authority and is a cause that requires support and sponsorship from City policymakers.\n\n311 Could Do More to Obtain Customer Feedback and Improve Service\n\nVital to 311’s success as a customer-facing organization is its ability to solicit, gather, and evaluate customer feedback to improve the City’s services. Although 311’s telephone survey shows that respondents are generally satisfied with the service provided by 311 call agents, it should take additional steps to obtain more feedback on how well service fulfillment departments are completing requests.\n\nCurrently, 311 passively receives written feedback on service requests through the website and mobile app or as caller comments, which it forwards to the appropriate department to respond. However, 311 only received 3,187 feedback comments between 2016 and 2020, a relatively low response rate for the 3.3 million requests it received through the call center, website, and mobile app. According to the 311 Director, the most common complaints that agents receive are about incomplete or incorrectly closed service requests.\n\nProactively obtaining end-to-end feedback on the customer’s journey—from service intake to service closure—would greatly enhance the City’s ability to improve service fulfillment. However, without explicit authority from City policymakers, the 311 Director believed that other departments would resist allowing 311 to take on this expanded role.\n\n311 Answers Many Calls That It Is Not Equipped to Handle\n\nAlthough no longer reflective of its multichannel operations, 311’s previous branding as “One Call to City Hall” encapsulates its goal to address as many routine requests as possible, without the need to transfer callers. However, 311 receives many calls that it is not equipped to handle, negatively impacting its ability to resolve customer needs the first time they call. Acting as the first tier call center for issues it cannot resolve forces 311 to transfer over 40% of calls answered to other parts of Los Angeles city government. This stands in sharp contrast to other cities in our comparison that only transfer between 5% and 20% of their 311 calls.\n\n311’s inability to assist many callers stems largely from the way City departments direct their call volume. All public calls for LADBS and non-emergency calls for the Department of Animal Services are first routed through 311, even though it is unable to provide specialized assistance. For example, 311 agents receive and transfer over 70% of calls related to questions about zoning, building codes, and permits that only LADBS staff can answer.\n\n311 also receives calls for issues that it is not empowered to resolve. For instance, many Angelenos naturally call 311 for non-emergency matters, including for issues that do not require an immediate public safety response. However, LAPD maintains its own separate telephone line to handle its non-emergency requests, including for noise complaints and other routine requests. If noise complaints and other routine requests throughout the City were available through 311, Angelenos and 311 agents alike would be empowered to submit these for departments for handling.\n\nCompounding the issue is the fact that callers waiting to speak with a 311 agent may face additional holds if they are transferred to another department to resolve their issue. Because callers must often wait before speaking with an agent, every call that 311 transfers is an unnecessary call that also increases average wait times. In 2019, wait times for 311 in Los Angeles averaged 3.3 minutes, including time callers spent waiting for a call back. By comparison, this is higher than many of its peers whose average wait time ranges between 10 seconds and 2.8 minutes.\n\nREVAMPING 311 GOING FORWARD\n\nAlthough City policymakers in the late 1990’s could not have predicted all of the internet’s present-day impacts, they had the foresight to incorporate “e government” concepts as part of their goals for a more forward-thinking and customer-centric 311 initiative. That vision eventually led to the implementation of the 311 CRM system, mobile app, and website.\n\nYet, nearly 20 years after launching the 311 call center in 2002, the gap between its partial successes and the City’s overall ambitions for improving customer service highlight the need to catch up with our peers while planning ahead for the future. This is especially true with evolving expectations from constituents, and with the advent of nascent technologies that once again hold the potential to transform how we interact.\n\nBut even if 311 were to implement new technologies, it cannot act alone. 311’s success is closely tied with its ability to garner support and participation across the City. However, fully implementing 311 or any other cross-departmental endeavor in the City is difficult in an environment of autonomous departments, who naturally want to own the processes, data, and resources for the services they provide, from beginning to end. Realizing 311’s benefits as a shared-services model requires deep inter-departmental collaboration, and a strong commitment to follow through with its implementation across the City.\n\nResolving the challenge of improving the City’s customer service for the next 20 years requires a new plan that re-evaluates and transforms how the City engages with Angelenos to meet their needs. Moreover, the new plan should also emphasize the ease-of-use, transparency, and accountability that is gained by treating 311 as not just a call center, but as a common customer service platform for disseminating information, taking in requests, and evaluating services provided by the City.\n\nFocusing on Requests Where 311 Can Deliver the Most Value\n\n311 is best suited for processing high volume, low complexity requests: offering access to many services that are relevant for most residents. However, 311 still competes with the Bureau of Sanitation and other departments to take in requests from the public.\n\nITA, Sanitation, and other departments should develop a migration plan to move more requests to 311 for processing, especially to self-service options like the mobile app. The migration plan should cover changes to public messaging, education, and outreach that encourages residents to use 311 and its mobile app. Doing so would result in more reports from residents being processed efficiently, and would allow the call centers operated by Sanitation and Street Services to focus on more specialized requests.\n\nITA and other departments should also create more types of routine service requests that are not currently integrated with the 311 CRM system. This is especially true for requests fulfilled by the LA Department of Transportation. Residents frequently report parking violations, abandoned vehicles, and issues with traffic signs and signals through the 311 mobile app’s uncategorized “Other” service request, which must be manually reviewed and forwarded to the correct department. Expanding the number of services available through 311 would empower Angelenos with more convenient self-service options and automatically route requests to the appropriate department.\n\nTo focus on better assisting Los Angeles residents, ITA and other departments should identify the types of requests currently flowing through 311 that require specialized technical assistance. This is especially true for LADBS and Animal Services, for whom 311 acts as a first tier call center for all their calls. The inability to distinguish appropriate requests that are within its scope, from inquiries where it does not add value, results in the need for 311 agents to triage and transfer over 40% of its calls to other parts of the City.\n\nOnce these frequently transferred calls are identified, 311 and other departments should develop a customer care strategy that (1) provides call handling protocols and enhanced training to empower 311 agents to assist callers, or (2) diverts callers away from 311 and directly to their ultimate destination. Giving callers the option to speak directly with the department for issues that 311 cannot resolve would significantly reduce 311’s call volume. For example, while it currently transfers about 40% of its calls handled, 311 could reduce its call volume by 21% if it focused on the top five most frequently transferred call types and found ways to more quickly route callers to their main destination.\n\nOne option 311 should explore is expanding its touch-tone telephone menu. Callers to 311 already have several self-service options to transfer themselves to other departments. Adding more self-service transfer options for calls that are frequently transferred by 311 agents would reduce the number of calls for 311 to answer, wait times for other 311 callers, and the number of transfers and wait times experienced by callers waiting to speak with other departments.\n\nCity policymakers should also consider a better way to fund 311’s operations, which currently relies on allocations from special funds used mainly by LADBS and the Bureau of Sanitation. The allocation amount from each fund based on the proportion of calls that 311 answers on their  behalf, including transferred calls.\n\nThe current funding model is especially challenging for issues handled by LADBS, for which all calls are first routed through 311 as the first tier call center. The City should not fund 311 as a first tier call center to screen calls for LADBS or other departments, particularly for issues where it cannot add value.\n\nAs 311 progressively takes on more routine requests for other departments, while diverting away calls that it cannot resolve, City policymakers will need to consider realigning funding staffing needs, and other resources to match 311’s new workload.\n\nInvesting in Community Engagement and Expanding Access\n\nAlthough users submit more requests through the mobile app than through 311’s other channels, 311 still suffers from a lack of public awareness of its available services. To ensure that more Angelenos are aware its services and engage with the City to report issues, 311 should develop a community engagement plan.\n\nCurrently, the City has taken a sporadic, patchwork approach to advertising for 311. ITA uses social media and the City’s public access television channel to reach out to residents about 311, and goes to several community events when requested. In addition, the City has recently done the following:\n\n311 street banner campaign in Council District 9 from October 2019 to October 2020;\nproposed a public awareness campaign in Council District 6 to encourage residents to call 311 or use the mobile app to request bulky item pickups and report illegal dumping;\nproposed translation of the 311 mobile app into Spanish and other languages, pending Council action on ITA’s proposal;\n$30,000 in one-time funding from the Board of Public Works in FY 2018 for marketing and outreach for the 311 call center and mobile app.\n\nOther cities in our review have dedicated resources for marketing and outreach within 311. For example, Charlotte’s 311 program has a speaker’s bureau program that rotates call agents to go out to the community and provide information and answer questions about 311. According to Charlotte’s 311 Division Manager, the speaker’s bureau attended 53 events in 2019 including a variety of events organized by the community and the city. Although Los Angeles’ 311 Director estimates that they attended a dozen or so public and community-requested events in 2019, the vast majority of their time and resources are dedicated to the call center’s operations.\n\nDallas’ 311 program also sends speakers out into the community but takes it one step further. It also operates a specially equipped van, called “City Hall on the Go,” to bring 311 services into the city’s neighborhoods. Dallas’ mobile van provides a variety of services in-person, giving residents the ability to pay water bills or parking violations, request city services through 311, obtain garage sale permits, and more.\n\n311 should also consider partnering with 211 in Los Angeles to coordinate their public messaging. Both share similar telephone numbers but act as central points of contact for different sets of services—311 for municipal services and 211 for social services. Banners on the website and mobile app, and as part of future public awareness campaigns can help residents make the right call by distinguishing between the services offered by 311 and 211.\n\nMeasuring Service Performance and Collecting Customer Feedback\n\nTransparency and accountability should be hallmarks of a new citywide customer service strategy, with 311’s role as a coordinator for improving how the City provides services. In line with these values, the first steps in this new multi-pronged approach should be to (1) develop estimated completion times for service requests; and (2) create a plan to proactively collect customer feedback.\n\n311 in other cities often refer to estimated completion times as service level agreements (SLA) with their partnering fulfillment departments. Although Los Angeles’ 311 has signed SLAs with most departments, the agreements are of minor consequence because they do not include time-bound goals for service requests. Instead, 311’s current SLAs asks signatory departments to assign content writers and editors to publish information articles for the citywide services directory, which 311’s call agents reference when providing information to the public.\n\nMore concerning is the fact that the Bureaus of Sanitation and Street Services have not signed an SLA, even though they fulfill 72% of service requests that were be submitted through the 311 call center, website, and mobile app. While the lack of a signed SLA does not prohibit 311 from working with Sanitation or others, it reflects the reluctance from departments for joining the 311 platform and its customer-oriented way of managing service requests.\n\nBringing the City up to speed on this standard approach for communicating and managing service requests will require departments to work with 311 to develop a new framework that includes protocols for:\n\nestablishing time-bound goals for as many service requests as possible;\ncommunicating these goals as estimated completion times to requesters; and\nperiodically reviewing service performance against these benchmarks, and decreasing\nthe estimated time it takes to complete a service request if warranted.\n\nTo establish estimated completion times, 311 and its partnering fulfillment departments could start with time-bound performance metrics that are already available internally or in the City’s budgeting process. Another way to create reasonable estimates for services times is to use existing 311 service data. For each service request type, 311 and other departments can determine the amount of time required to close a request ticket, rank them from quickest to slowest to close, and calculate the number of days it takes to close 80% of the quickest request tickets.\n\nThe new SLAs with departments should also create a framework that describes 311’s role to proactively seek direct input from the City’s customers. 311 could start by following San Antonio and others and emailing a survey to customers at request closure. Doing so could generate a higher response rate than 311’s currently passive method for collecting feedback.\n\nThe survey sent by 311 could ask customers to rate the quality of the service provided, their satisfaction with how the City handled their request, and allow for open comments to explain their ratings such as an issue that persists even after the request was closed. By using surveys and other research methods to listen to the experiences, information, and insights offered by residents, the City could vastly improve its operations.\n\nLessons Learned from the Implementation of the 311 CRM System\n\nFive years after its public go-live in January 2016, ITA and other departments using the 311 CRM system have already acknowledged the need for a replacement, and have cited the following as some of their greatest frustrations:\n\nsignificant system slowdowns and downtimes that impact the system’s usability;\nlimited reporting capabilities;\nserver hardware that has already reached the end of its useful life;\ncomplex system customizations resulting in high development costs; and\nhigh ongoing costs for maintenance and system support.\n\nHowever, the City’s presently dire fiscal situation makes it difficult to envision paying for a replacement system at this time. Still, problems with the current system’s procurement and project management provide important lessons to learn before the City begins to search for a new IT system to manage service requests.\n\nADDITIONAL LESSONS FOR THE FUTURE\n\nWhile many of the recommendations above to revamp 311 would put the City on par with other 311 programs, policymakers also have the opportunity to plan for the future. Incorporating new business practices and technologies, some of which are discussed below, should be part of the City’s strategic planning process to influence 311 and customer engagement for the next 20 years.\n\nIncorporating User-Centered Design to Improve 311’s Constituent Experience\n\nIf the City moves forward with a CRM system replacement project, it would also benefit by incorporating input from 311’s most important stakeholders: the residents of Los Angeles. User-centered design is part of a growing user experience movement to improve digital services in government by incorporating user input. User experience best practices involves evaluating user interactions with the design and content of a digital product to improve its usability, including how easily new users can learn to use a service, and how quickly and efficiently experienced users can accomplish tasks.\n\nITA reported some efforts to incorporate user-centered design into the current 311 website and mobile phone app. However, ITA also reported some resistance from the departments because of the impact that simplifying service request intake could have on how they fulfilled services.\n\nAs part of their recent CRM system replacements and upgrades, San Antonio, Dallas, and Chicago each hired consultants to develop a customer engagement process that gathered the public’s input on how to improve 311. As a result, each city made changes to their 311 programs to better meet the needs of their constituents. For example, key findings from San Antonio’s user design study resulted in changes to its 311 service request forms, such as visual aids, to make them easier to use.\n\nThrough focus groups, online forums, and discussions, Chicago’s 311 Department learned that its residents wanted to see how quickly the city was completing the service requests submitted in their neighborhood. As a result, Chicago implemented a map explorer feature as part of its 311 CRM replacement project that completed in 2020. The map explorer allows residents to view live, updated statuses of recent service requests across Chicago on their 311 website and mobile phone app. Although Los Angeles’ 311 website and mobile app can detect potentially duplicate services when users submit a report, a live map of recently submitted requests would give Angelenos better insight on how the City is working for them.\n\nImplementing Artificial Intelligence Can Enhance 311\n\nAlthough still a nascent technology, the contact center industry has found several applications for artificial intelligence (AI) to improve self-service for customers and reduce costs. Other cities have adopted these industry practices in various ways to improve 311’s operations and ease of use for constituents.\n\nNew York City’s 311 program employs an interactive voice response (IVR) system with speech recognition to capture the caller’s spoken request and determine their intent to provide information or route the caller to the appropriate agency. By using its IVR system with speech recognition to handle many types of simple requests, NYC 311 was able improve agent availability by 25%. Dallas 311 has also deployed a similar IVR system with natural language understanding. According to the Los Angeles’ 311 Director, ITA also plans to add virtual agent capabilities in the near future as part of its telephone greeting system and website chatbot.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) promises to improve natural language understanding technology even further. In Illinois, a deluge of COVID-19 related phone calls and web inquiries unemployment benefits flooded its Department of Employment Security. To address this problem, Illinois deployed AI-powered conversational virtual agents to answer questions and help residents file unemployment claims by phone and web chat. AI-powered contact center technologies are increasingly capable of handling self-service requests with low complexity and urgency and should be explored by the City and 311.\n\nAI’s use cases also extend to making 311 more user friendly. Although San Francisco’s 311 mobile app and website are most popular way for residents to submit service requests, user error caused many requests to be routed to the wrong agency. To improve 311 request routing, San Francisco used its Startup in Resident program to identify a vendor that developed an AI- based solution to identify the correct service fulfillment department. Dallas’ 311 mobile app also uses AI to power an image recognition feature that recommends types of service requests based only on photos taken on a user’s smartphone.\n\nEvolving from a Multichannel to an Omnichannel Contact Center\n\n311 already offers multiple contact channels through its call center, website, and mobile app, and in the future may choose to add more options such as web chat, virtual agent telephone self-service and chatbots. But to create a more effective customer experience, the City should consider how it can integrate these different channels to create an omnichannel environment that allows customers to seamlessly move from one touchpoint to the next.\n\nOmnichannel contact center environments integrate their different contact channels to build customer profiles based on their previous interaction history across various contact methods. Using this data to create a single, unified view of the customer, agents can pull up a history of issues before connecting with the caller and provide the status of previously requested services. Integrating between contact channels also helps to ensure that customers can choose their preferred self-service contact channel, as well as escalating to a live agent if needed.\n\nRelevant information would follow the customer across different contact methods, allowing agents to push issue histories and other information to the next agent during transfers. Having many departments across the City on the same contact center platform also creates unifying experience that would resolve many of the pain points experienced by residents that are currently being transferred between departments, such as the need to provide the issue’s history and context again to the next agent.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nAt its best, 311 is more than an easy-to-remember telephone number; it offers a “no wrong door” approach to helping residents find the right information and services that they need from their local government. Realizing 311’s benefits for the residents of Los Angeles requires sustained leadership and support to ensure its full implementation throughout the City.\n\nBefore embarking on its implementation of the 311 call center, City policymakers were warned about the “apathy and opposition” that 311 would face from other departments because of its customer-centric approach to managing service requests. Overcoming that resistance to change then, as now, requires City policymakers to weigh in on a revised citywide customer contact strategy.\n\nCity Council Recommendations\n\nTo ensure greater inter-departmental collaboration and a more coordinated approach, we recommend that the City Council should consider the following:\n\nINSTRUCT ITA, with the assistance of all other related departments, to prepare and present a citywide customer contact strategy that re-evaluates how the City engages with its residents and the role of 311 and other department call centers. At a minimum, the new strategy should include specific plans to:\nIdentify routine requests and migrates requesters from department call centers to 311 service channels. In addition, the plan should separately identify frequently transferred requests that should be handled by department call centers instead;\nIdentify and create more types of routine service requests for 311 that are not currently integrated with the 311 CRM system;\nShift the workload, staffing, training, and funding resources for routine and specialized requests to their appropriate centers at 311 and the departments;\nUpdate service level agreements to establish, communicate, and periodically update estimated completion times for as many service requests as possible;\nUpdate service level agreements to include protocols for how 311 will gather customer feedback for closed service request and share this information with departments;\nIncrease community engagement efforts and expand access to 311;\nIncorporate user-centered design, artificial intelligence, omnichannel integration, and other new technologies and practices as part of the future of 311;\nImplement lessons learned from the 311 CRM system project outlined below.\nDepartment Recommendations\n\nITA should incorporate the lessons learned from its experience implementing the 311 CRM system and improve its practices for project planning and management, and contract management. If the City moves forward with a 311 CRM system replacement, ITA should:\n\nConduct a deeper dive to understand stakeholder needs, and develop specific requirements\nthat are used as part of a comprehensive evaluation of proposed IT solutions;\nIncorporate timelines for departmental business process re-engineering into its IT project\ntimelines;\nEmploy better contract management practices and hold vendors to agreed-upon costs;\nApply organizational change management practices to secure active participation and\nsupport throughout the project’s lifecycle;\nConsider hiring independent validation and verification (IV&V) and independent project\noversight (IPO) services to better ensure a major IT project’s successful delivery."

Large numbers of people of different races, ethnicities and cultures live here; myriad religions and ideologies flourish; residents of all sexual orientations and gender identities populate our neighborhoods. These are just some of the ways Angelenos differ, and those differences create a multilayered mosaic around us. Different people bring with them unique experiences, which are the foundation of new hopes, beliefs and a better collective future.\n\nBut, as diverse as it is, Los Angeles is not the most equitable city in America. With surging levels of homelessness, poverty and food insecurity plaguing some neighborhoods and ethnic groups far more than others — only heightened by the ongoing pandemic — too many in our City do not enjoy all the opportunities our region has to offer.\n\nLocal government is not immune to the outside influences that shape society, but it can and should champion fairness both in word and deed, including with its own workforce. In recent years, L.A.’s leaders have enacted laws, issued directives and created a department and task force to achieve greater racial and gender diversity and equity.\n\nLast summer, my office pointed to some of these laudable efforts, while also noting how much work remains. In our report, “Closing the Gap: Women’s Pay and Representation at the City of L.A,” the Controller’s Office revealed that women City employees earned 76 percent of what men made and offered recommendations to level the playing field. That report spurred action by the City Council, which is currently working with my office to address these concerns.\n\nMy latest report scrutinizes two complimentary issues: diversity and pay inequity among City employees of different ethnicities, specifically pointing out the lower pay earned by employees of color, and women of color most of all.\n\nPay inequity impacts workers of color\n\nThe report details the racial and ethnic composition of the City’s workforce, zeroing in on specific departments. Of the largest, Fire and Building and Safety are among the least diverse, while the Department of Transportation and the Airports Department are among the most. The City’s workforce has become more diverse over time and currently reflects the ethnic composition of L.A. Nearly 73 percent of the workforce are people of color, and the proportion of Asian and Black employees exceeds that of the City’s population. Of note, 81 percent of women City workers are people of color.\n\nAs essential as it is, achieving greater diversity alone is not enough to overcome barriers to equity. A payroll analysis found considerable disparities in pay and overtime among different ethnic groups at the City. Caucasian (white) male employees came out on top of every compensation category while women of color were at the bottom.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), white City workers earned $53 per hour on average, and Black and Hispanic employees earned $44 per hour. Women — especially women of color — earned less than men in all categories. In fact, Black women earned 25% less than the average gross salary for City workers, while white men earned 21% more than the average. All but two of the City’s top 100 earners were men.\n\nOvertime statistics also showed imbalances. The City paid $876 million in overtime over the last fiscal year, with 70% to Hispanic and Caucasian men, mostly sworn employees. Although overtime earnings vary tremendously, the average amount paid to white men was nearly $31,000 — the highest of all ethnic groups — while Asian women earned the least at $7,747.\n\nA fairer City\n\nThe City must do more to increase diversity, especially in departments that lag behind, and decrease pay inequity for workers of color. My report makes the following recommendations:\n\nSupport the efforts of the City’s Racial Equity Task Force to develop strategies that increase diversity and address the pay gap for employees of color.\nUse the data in this report to inform Council about the impact of racial inequity in hiring and promotion, and to formulate recommendations on how to fix it.\nPromote transparency by publishing updated demographic information for full-time employees, including workforce diversity data and average pay by race and gender.\n\nI urge City leaders to adopt these recommendations to engender greater equity for L.A.’s employees of color today and for those who will join the City family in the future.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nEvents of 2020 have pushed the nation and our City to examine the impact of longstanding attitudes and actions about race.  This has provided an opportunity to address inequities and work towards eliminating structural racism in our society.  The City of Los Angeles is one of the most diverse jurisdictions in America, and as a government institution with more than 50,000 full-time employees, should maintain a workforce that is reflective of the community it serves.  Diversity increases employee awareness and fosters respect for differing viewpoints.  Thought leaders in Human Resources indicate that diversity in the workplace helps to improve overall productivity, creativity, and performance within an organization.\n\nIn August 2020, the Office of the City Controller issued a report entitled “Closing the Gap: Women’s Pay and Representation at the City of L.A”.  Based on interest in that report’s findings and additional requests, we conducted a new analysis focused on the racial diversity of the City’s workforce, the subject of this report.\n\nOur analysis found that the City’s workforce, as a whole, closely reflects the racial composition of all Angelenos.  Nearly 73% of the City’s workforce are people of color, and the proportion of Asian and Black employees exceeds that of the City’s resident population.  Of note, 81% of women working for the City are people of color.  Over the last fifteen years, the City has steadily increased its employment of people of color from 65% to the current 73%, and there is greater diversity among the City’s newer employees –those with fewer than five years of City service.  A few City Departments lag behind in diversity measures; specifically, Fire, Building & Safety, and the Zoo.\n\nWhile the City’s total workforce may mirror our community, our analysis found there is significant disparity in hourly pay, gross earnings, and overtime among racial groups.  In every compensation category, Caucasian men rank first.\n\nCity employees earn, on average, $48 per hour; however, for Caucasian workers the average rate is $53; while it is about $44 for Black and Hispanic employees. The average hourly rate paid to women is lower than that for men in all race categories.\nOf the top 100 earners in 2019, 56 are Caucasian (all men), while 21 are Hispanic, 15 are Black and 8 are Asian.\nDuring FY 2020, the City paid $6 billion in gross pay to full-time employees; about 31% of that amount was paid to Caucasians who comprise 27% of the workforce.\nThe average gross amount paid to full-time City employees was $112,417. Caucasian men were paid, on average $135,886, which is 21% above the citywide average, while Black women were paid $83,866, or 25% below the average amount.\nThe City paid $876 million in overtime, of which 70% went to Hispanic and Caucasian men. Though individuals’ overtime earnings vary tremendously, the average amount earned by Caucasian men was $30,945, the highest of all groups, which is especially notable when compared to Asian women, who averaged $7,747 in overtime earnings.\n\nTo support efforts of fairness and diversity, in June 2020 the Mayor created a Racial Equity Task Force and created the Department of Human and Civil Rights.  The City should monitor trends related to equity in its workforce and identify ways to promote diversity, especially for higher paid positions.  In addition, the City should encourage employee development through training and recognition, and support a healthy work environment that values diversity and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment.  The information presented in this report should be used to:\n\nSupport the planned efforts (and those already underway) by the City’s Racial Equity Task Force to develop strategies to increase diversity and achieve compensation equity at all levels of the City workforce.\nInform the study being conducted by the Chief Equity Officer, the City Administrative Office and the Personnel Department to determine whether there are disparate impacts along the lines of race in hiring, promotion, pay, and access to privilege such as overtime where such impacts are occurring.\nPromote transparency by publicizing demographic information of the City’s full-time employees, including data related to workforce composition and average earnings that considers race and gender. Update and publish this information on an annual basis in order to measure the impact of City efforts to increase diversity and equity.\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City of Los Angeles’ greatest asset is the dedicated workforce that provides critical and needed public services to Angelenos.  The City seeks to hire and retain a diverse workforce that is reflective of the community it serves.  Events of 2020 have pushed the nation and our City to examine the impact of longstanding attitudes and actions, so we can address inequities and work towards eliminating structural racism in our society and government institutions.\n\nIn June 2020, the Mayor created a Department of Human and Civil Rights and issued Executive Directive No. 27, which reiterated that City Departments and Offices shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in employment, education, or contracting.  To support ongoing efforts of fairness, diversity, equal opportunity, and transparency in the City, each Department and Office was to designate a Racial Equity Officer and develop Racial Equity Plans to identify indicators that could be used track progress towards achieving more racial equity.  The Mayor also established a Racial Equity Task Force and directed the Personnel Department to develop and provide mandatory training on implicit bias for all employees.\n\nA statewide ballot initiative presented the possibility of implementing affirmative action policies and programs which could be used by the City in recruitment and procurement decisions; however, Proposition 16 was defeated by the electorate.  Nonetheless, policymakers are committed to promoting equity and there are many ways to enhance diversity without affirmative action.  Identifying disparities through routine data analyses, developing plans, and measuring results over time, support these efforts.\n\nIn August 2020, the Office of the City Controller issued a report entitled “Closing the Gap: Women’s Pay and Representation at the City of L.A”.  Based on interest in that report’s findings and additional requests, we conducted a new analysis focused on the racial diversity of the City’s workforce, which is the subject of this report.  Similar to the gender analyses, we used the profile data for all full-time City employees and their related earnings as noted by the City’s payroll system.\n\nIt is important to note that employees’ self-reported race/ethnicity as noted in the legacy payroll system (PaySR) differs somewhat from U.S. Census data, which clarifies that the concept of race is separate from the concept of Hispanic origin.  While PaySR indicates only one of a possible ten categories, the decennial census and related reporting estimates provide data on 14 non-mutually exclusive categories. To simplify comparisons for this report’s presentation on the employee population, we have presented City workforce data aligned as closely as possible with census data, in five primary categories; see the crosswalk below:\n\nRACIAL DIVERSITY IN THE CITY'S WORKFORCE\nComparative Population Data\n\nAs of July 2020, the City of Los Angeles had 50,393 full-time employees. Of these, 19,808 (39%) identify as Hispanic, 13,576 (27%) identify as Caucasian, 7,810 (15%) identify as Black, 7,856 (16%) identify as Asian (including Filipino), and 1,323 (3%) identify as being another ethnicity or is unknown (i.e., 175 American Indian, 839 “other”, 228 “unknown”, 4 Pacific Islander, and 77 “two or more races”).\n\nWe used the US Census Bureau’s estimates for Los Angeles City to determine if the City’s full-time workforce mirrors the community we serve.  While Caucasian employees and residents are roughly the same percentage, the City workforce has an even greater proportion of Asian and Black individuals than the region’s residents.  And while Hispanics may appear to be under-represented on the workforce, it is important to keep in mind that the Hispanic/Latino ethnicity is considered and reported slightly differently by the US Census data as compared to internal City payroll records.\n\nSworn LAPD and LAFD Employees\n\nSworn employees of the Police and Fire Departments may be the most visible of all the City’s public employees.  Directly serving our community, sworn members of LAPD and LAFD comprise 26% of the total workforce.\n\nThe racial composition of sworn employees at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) almost mirrors that of the City’s residents.  The City’s Personnel Department has devoted significant efforts to attract a more diverse applicant pool for sworn positions at LAPD, and in September 2020 LAPD reported having its most diverse recruit class in its history.\n\nAt the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD), almost half of all its sworn members are Caucasian.  In 2014, the City removed two prerequisites that had been required prior to applying for the firefighter job classification (although the EMT certification and Physical Ability Test are still required before starting employment); this has reportedly helped provide a more diverse applicant pool.  Further, after a firefighter applicant passes a cognitive and soft skills test, the Personnel Department uses a stratified random sampling methodology based upon combinations of gender and race to determine the applicants who go on to the next step, which results in maintaining a similar representation of applicants through the entire hiring process.  It has been widely acknowledged that continued efforts are necessary to help increase the gender and racial diversity within LAFD.\n\nThe City’s Personnel Department supports most City Departments and Offices in their recruitment of open (typically entry-level) job classifications.  When a civil service job application is offered, the Personnel Department evaluates the gender and race of employees within the current job classification to determine if there is a need to develop a Targeted Recruitment Plan, which can include additional advertising through various professional and trade associations and organizations.\n\nDiversity and Gender in the City’s Workforce\n\nA further breakdown to show diversity by gender is presented below.  Among women, there are proportionately more Black and Asian employees, while among men there is a higher proportion of Caucasian and Hispanic employees.\n\nDiversity Among City Functions and Largest Departments\n\nThe City classifies its personnel and budgetary information into nine broad functions:  Protection of Persons and Property; Business Type Activities; General Government; Public Works; Health & Sanitation; Cultural & Recreational Services; Transportation; Community Development; and Retirement/Pensions.  There are notable distinctions in race by City function, as compared to census data:\n\nHispanic and Caucasian employees have the highest representation (32% and 43% respectively) within the protection of persons and property function;\nBlack employees have the highest representation (31%) within the transportation function;\nAsian employees have the highest representation (40%) within the retirement and pension\n\nThe ten largest City Departments represent approximately 80% of the City’s total workforce.  When comparing the race of employees working in these Departments to the total workforce and to census data, a few notable distinctions emerge:  Public Works – Street Lighting has the lowest representation of Black employees at 6%, which is lower than the estimated 9% of Black Angelenos; while Airports and Transportation have the highest representation of Black employees at 31% each.  LAFD has the highest representation of Caucasian employees at 46%, which is more than the 27% of Caucasian employees on the City’s workforce and the 28% of estimated Caucasian Angelenos.\n\nAppendix I provides the demographics of all full-time employees working in each City Department.\n\nYears of Service\n\nAmong employees with fewer than five years of service, there appears to be more diversity than the rest of the workforce.  While Caucasian employees represent 27% of the total City workforce, they comprise 23% of newer employees, but 34% of the longest-term City employees.  This seems to indicate that the workforce has become more diverse in recent years.\n\nWhen separately evaluating sworn employees, LAPD’s diversity has also been increasing in recent years, though for LAFD, diversity based on years of service appears less consistent.\n\nPoint in Time Counts – Diversity over Two Decades\n\nWe measured the ratio of non-Caucasians, referred to here as People of Color, within the City’s workforce for four periods, July of 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020.  By comparing the racial composition for all full-time employees, we see there has been a steady increase in the ratio of employees who identify as People of Color, from 65% in 2005 to 73% in 2020.  This is been especially prevalent among the sworn ranks of LAPD, which has risen from 57% to 70% over fifteen years, while there has been a small increase among the sworn members of LAFD.\n\nHOURLY PAY, GROSS PAY AND OVERTIME\nPay Rates\n\nCity employees, on average, earn $48 per hour.  However, when evaluating the average pay rate by racial group, Black employees and employees that identify as being another ethnicity (i.e., other, unknown, two or more races, or American Indian) have the lowest average hourly rates, while Caucasian and Asian employees have the highest average hourly rates.\n\nWhen further evaluating average hourly pay by gender, women are paid less than men of the same race in all categories.\n\nAbout 90% of all full-time City employees earn between $50 and $75 per hour.  However, by examining those in classifications with the lowest pay rates (<$25/hour) and those at the highest (>$101/hour), we see notable differences with Hispanic and Caucasian groups:\n\nHispanic employees are 39% of the workforce; and account for 54% of those earning the lowest rates, and 17% of those at the highest rates.\nCaucasian employees are 27% of the workforce, and account for just 9% of those earning the lowest rates, but 54% of those at the highest rates.\nThe remaining groups are within seven percentage points of their overall proportion of the workforce.\n\nEach job classification has an established hourly pay range that is agreed upon with employee labor unions.  All City employees holding a similar job classification are paid within the same hourly pay range regardless of gender or race (placement within the range is determined by years of service within the job class).  That said, there is less diversity within jobs with the highest pay rates.\n\nThere are about 500 employees in job classifications making more than $101 an hour; these include several high level Office of the City Attorney job classifications, assistant and general manager job classifications, and elected officials.  These positions are salaried, and thus are not eligible to earn overtime.\n\nThere are about 3,000 employees in job classifications making $25 or less per hour; these include council aides, accounting clerks, custodians, gardener caretakers, maintenance laborers, management assistants, administrative clerks, security officers, and traffic officers.\n\nWhile the City has hundreds of job classifications, forty-one positions each have at least 200 employees, which collectively comprise 58% of the total workforce.  Appendix II presents the demographic data, including average wage rates, for the City employees occupying those positions.\n\nGross Pay Analysis\n\nAn employee’s gross pay includes their regular hourly pay, bonuses, overtime, any adjustments that occurred during the year, and any payments for accrued leave at termination.  Due to the significant additions to pay through overtime and other supplemental pay, only 20 of the Top 100 Earners in 2019 were employees who were paid at the highest hourly rate (>$101/hour).\n\nOf the 100 highest paid City employees, 56 are Caucasian, while 21 are Hispanic, 15 are Black, and 8 are Asian.  As reported in our Gender Equity report, only two of the top 100 were women; both are women of color (non-Caucasian) at the General Manager level.  See Appendix III.\n\nDuring FY 2020, the City’s full-time employees received $6 billion in gross pay.  We analyzed data based on overall proportion of gross amounts paid to different groups and compared the average amounts paid to individuals within race and gender categories.\n\nWorkforce employee counts, like census data, are based on a point in time, while gross pay is presented over a period of time.  Comparing the composition of the City’s workforce (from Exhibit 1), to the allocation of the total amount paid to all full-time employees during FY 2020 shows just minor variances:\n\nTo determine the average gross amount paid to individual employees, we must consider all employees who received any pay during FY 2020.  Based on our analysis, City employees received an average of $112,417; however, when comparing average gross pay by racial category, disparities are clearly noted.\n\nCaucasian employees received the highest average pay, while Black employees and employees who identify as another ethnicity or race (i.e., unknown, American Indian, other, two or more races) received the lowest.  By further delineating gross pay by gender, women averaged less across all groups, with the widest disparity between the genders among Caucasian and Hispanic employees.  For example, Black women on the City’s workforce earned 25% below the average gross amount paid, while Caucasian men earned 21% above the average; the difference between the average pay for those two groups is $52,000.\n\nPaid Overtime\n\nDuring FY 2020, about 39,000 City employees were paid overtime, totaling $876 million.  The majority of this additional pay went to sworn employees of LAPD and LAFD and trade positions at LADWP.  While the average overtime paid was $22,560, when further segmenting the analysis by the race and gender, we see that the average paid overtime is significantly higher for Caucasian men than that for women who identify as being Asian or another race (i.e., unknown, two or more races, American Indian, or other).  A reasonable explanation is that significant overtime is typically earned by sworn members of LAFD and trade positions within LADWP, and both these employee groups include these include a higher proportion of Caucasian men.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nCity management strives to maintain a workforce that reflects the community we serve.  Gender and racial diversity are valued in the workplace, as it encourages increased awareness of and respect for differing viewpoints; leading practices cite that this improves overall productivity, creativity, and performance.\n\nThis analyses shows that the City’s workforce is extremely diverse.  The Personnel Department appears to be making great strides in recruiting to achieve more diversity, especially within LAFD’s and LAPD’s sworn workforce.  The City should continue to monitor trends related to equity in the workforce and identify ways to promote diversity, especially for the higher level (and thus higher paid) City positions.  These actions should include encouraging employee development through training and recognition, and supporting a healthy work environment that values diversity and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment.\n\nThe information presented in this report should be used by policymakers to:\n\nInstruct the Personnel Department and request the Chief Equity Officer to report to the Council relative to how the data in “Diversity with Equity: Achieving Fairness at the City of Los Angeles” will be used to inform and support current and future efforts by the City’s Racial Equity Task Force, to develop an action plan to further increase diversity in the City’s workforce and address the pay gap among employees of color.\nInstruct the City Administrative Officer and the Personnel Department, with the assistance of the Chief Equity Officer, to utilize the data in “Diversity with Equity: Achieving Fairness at the City of Los Angeles,” and report to Council with an assessment of whether there are disparate impacts along the lines of race in hiring and promotion, to identify where such impacts are occurring, and provide recommendations on how the City should address said issues.\nInstruct the Personnel Department to report to Council annually with an update of demographic information of the City’s full-time employees, including data related to workforce composition and average earnings by race and gender in order to measure the impact of City efforts to increase diversity and equity in the workforce. Further, instruct the Personnel Department to update and publish this information on the City’s website so that the information is regularly available to the public.\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix I: Workforce Demographics by Department\n\nAppendix II: Top Job Classifications\n\nAppendix III: Top 100 Earners of 2019"

The City of Los Angeles strives to do both as well as possible. On the representational side, the goal is to involve residents in determining local public needs and how these needs can be met. Administratively, the City and its 44,000 employees offer numerous services that Angelenos count on, such as trash pickup, permitting and inspections, street and tree maintenance, public safety, park preservation, youth and senior services and more. Traditionally, City services have been delivered in-person, at different locations, and with paper forms, if required — and City workers have shown up to designated worksites each day.\n\nWhile in-person assistance is imperative in certain circumstances and preferable in others, it is not always the most effective way to get residents the help they need. People expect their interactions with the government to be as seamless and simple as possible, similar to the best private sector customer service providers. The City’s current ability to deliver digital services and the steps it must take to improve them is the subject of my current report.\n\nBenefits of digital government\n\nLos Angeles has moved toward improving its digital service delivery in recent years, and with the unexpected global pandemic these efforts were pushed to the fore. COVID-19 made some in-person services, such as those at customer counters, nearly impossible and forced many City employees to work virtually. Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus, it also served as a catalyst to implement digital innovations or accelerate projects already underway, including hosting virtual meetings to facilitate public hearings, rolling out a telemedicine pilot to reduce ambulance dispatches, developing online training sessions for seniors and scaling up a largely unused telework program from 30 employees to 10,000 to keep City workers safe.\n\nThese innovations, largely born of necessity, deserve to be examined and expanded, accompanied by a unified plan to broaden digital services and improve the customer experience for all Angelenos. The Mayor’s Executive Directive 29, urging more contactless services, is a step in the right direction. Before the City fully re-opens its offices to the public, it needs to thoroughly reassess its ability to deliver the digital services residents expect and deserve.\n\nMy office found that Los Angeles currently has much room for improvement, as many services that could be done online or remotely — certain permits, reservations, registrations, inspections and more — still rely on paper or must be done in person. This is primarily because there is no overarching City strategy to enhance digital service delivery. As of now, it is left up to departments, resulting in a fragmented approach. The City should use this unique period when online services are required to develop greater digital options that bolster existing services. \n\nGrowing the City’s digital capabilities must also mean empowering the workforce and the people it serves. Many City workers have found that they can not only successfully telework, but have been happier and more productive doing so over the last six months. Institutionalizing this new efficiency should be a priority. And, as a matter of equity for those served, broadband accessibility must be part of the discussion. Areas of the City where access to broadband is spotty or nonexistent cannot be left behind. My report posits that these factors need to be considered while planning strategically to expand digital service options. If done properly, this could allow far more people to access City services, and also lead to an improved customer experience, better performance and a stronger connection to our City overall.\n\nReimagining services \n\nAs the City continues to adapt to the difficulties posed by COVID-19, it should reimagine the way it uses technology to deliver services, both for City employees and the people they serve. My report makes the following recommendations:\n\nAdopt a digital services strategy that includes the City’s overall vision, objectives, and plan for providing digital services to the public. The strategy should be drafted by a working group or committee consisting of staff from City departments, Council, and the Mayor’s Office, with significant input from the public, and include clear goals and a road map to ensure its success.\nAdopt a framework to support telework as a viable City workforce strategy, with implementation led by the Personnel Department, and require all departments to develop a policy to determine eligibility for their employees.\n\nThere is no better time to adopt a novel approach to digital services that aligns with the City’s values and places customer and employee needs first. Innovation need not wait for the pandemic to end or for another challenge to begin. I urge City leaders to adopt a forward-thinking plan that both benefits and engages more Angelenos.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nCOVID-19 has presented a number of challenges for government, with social distancing requirements placing limits on services that still require paper inputs or in-person delivery. However, COVID-19 has also served as a catalyst to implement new innovations or accelerate projects already underway. Within the City of Los Angeles, those ideas and projects include: \n\nhosting virtual meetings to facilitate public hearings for the City’s land use development process and Neighborhood Council meetings;\ndeveloping online training sessions for family caregivers of older adults while the City’s multi-purpose senior centers are closed;\nrolling out a new telemedicine pilot to monitor low-acuity patients, reduce ambulance dispatches, and reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms; and\nscaling up its telework program to ensure that City employees can continue working while limiting the risk of exposure and spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, emerging technologies representing potentially huge shifts in society have also found applications in other jurisdictions. \n\nVirtual agents powered by artificial intelligence have been deployed to deal with overwhelming call volumes related to COVID-19 and unemployment questions.\n\n \n\nMobile phone applications are being developed to aid COVID-19 contact tracing efforts while maintaining privacy through blockchain encryption.\n\n \n\nGovernments at all levels are looking to virtual and augmented reality to help with community engagement, firefighting, and training.\n\n \n\nHowever, as the City gradually re-opens, it should continue reassessing its processes and deliver the digital services that Angelenos expect and deserve. The City has a long way to go – many services, payment options, and internal processes still rely heavily on paper or in-person service delivery. Instead of simply returning to these outdated processes, the City should continue its momentum and develop even more digital options to supplement existing services.\n\nAt the same time, barriers to accessing a computer and high-speed internet, especially among lower-income households, means that the benefits of online services are less likely to reach those with the greatest need. Within the City, this digital divide is particularly true in low-income areas like South LA. These facts are even more pronounced during COVID-19 as more activities are brought online, making internet access an essential service. More digital inclusion programs — like the City’s OurCycle LA project to provide computers to underserved communities — are needed to bridge this gap.\n\nCreating more digital service options while planning strategically – As the City gradually moves towards re-opening, our difficult fiscal environment also means that we must do more with less. New technologies can empower City employees to meet increasing demand while allowing them to focus on work valued by the people we serve. In that vein, the Mayor’s recent Executive Directive 29, which also advocates for more digital and contactless government services, is a step in the right direction.\n\nIn addition, growing the City’s digital services holds the promise of many other benefits, including:\n\nincreased accessibility;\nimproved customer experience;\nenhanced City performance; and\nmore civic engagement.\n\nSome specific opportunities include replacing more of its paper applications (e.g., reducing the paper products it issues such as residential parking hang tags) and supplementing in-person services, such as field inspections, with virtual options.  \n\nWhile the benefits are clear, the question remains about how to effectively coordinate and implement these initiatives across a decentralized network of City departments – each with its own unique set of processes and priorities. The City’s Information Technology Agency (ITA) provides direct IT services and support for the City, and advises other City departments on their technology projects. However, ITA’s role as a consultant and support unit, combined with the City’s culture of departmental autonomy, limits its ability to strategically coordinate the use of technology across the City. \n\nThis limitation was also recognized by the City’s Innovation and Performance Commission. As part of its mission to identify and support ideas to improve City government, the commission voted in 2015 to fund a pilot program that worked across the City to develop new digital services. Although no longer funded, the pilot program provided important lessons on how the City should collaborate to develop digital services. Other cities, such as San Francisco, have taken a more deliberate and sustained approach by adopting a longer-term strategy for implementing shared digital services.\n\nThe City should also develop a digital services strategy that provides direction and leadership for its public-facing services. The lack of a unified strategy in the City has resulted in fragmented digital services of varying quality. For example, simple building projects that only require permits from the Department of Building and Safety can be obtained entirely online. However, larger projects may require additional approvals from many other departments, each with their own method for applying, submitting documents, and paying for inspection fees. \n\nAlthough Building and Safety is currently working with other departments to incorporate their permitting services into the same online platform, the current lack of a unified permitting system and process means that contractors and other customers must continue navigating through the City’s disjointed development process.\n\nFragmented processes like these can be improved with the help of a digital services strategy that aligns departments toward a common set of values that places customer needs first, promotes cross-department collaboration through a new governance structure, and empowers a digital services agency to work with departments to execute new projects.  \n\nAdopting requirements and best practices to sustain telework – The City’s forced experiment with telework during COVID-19 has shown that it can strengthen business continuity planning. At the same time, studies have shown that telework can also increase productivity, increase recruitment and retention, and even reduce real estate and other costs. \n\nTo ensure that telework remains a critical part of the City’s workforce strategy and emergency planning, the City should adopt certain requirements and best practices from the federal government to provide institutional support for the wide implementation of telework even after the pandemic has subsided. These include requiring departments to develop telework policies with eligibility and participation criteria that fit their operational needs, determining eligibility, and notifying employees of their eligibility to participate in telework.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nCOVID-19 has created a new normal that the City is still navigating. However, that new reality is also one that includes more digital services than ever before. The City has demonstrated its ability to adapt and should continue rethinking its processes and creatively using technology to improve its customer service for all Angelenos.\n\nTo build on these existing efforts, City Policymakers should consider the recommendations in this report to serve as a guide for developing a collaborative digital services strategy. In addition, the City’s support for telework as a workforce and business continuity strategy hinges on its adoption of the recommended best practices.\n\nRecommendation #1\n\nConsider developing and adopting a digital services strategy that includes the City’s overall vision, objectives, and plan for providing digital services for the public. At minimum, the strategy should include:\n\ncreating or designating a working group or committee to guide the strategy’s development, consisting of staff from City departments, Council, and Mayor’s Office to promote collaboration and accountability;\ndeveloping shared values and goals for the City’s digital services based on the successes and challenges of implementing services online. This effort should also include significant public input to address digital equity issues and the needs of the City’s customers and end-users; and\nestablishing a high-level road map for achieving its goals, which should include consideration for a new governance structure, such as a committee that is empowered to prioritize and oversee digital service projects and promote collaboration across the City, and the need to create a digital services unit within the City that is dedicated to providing digital leadership in the City and implementing its strategy.\n\nRecommendation #2\n\nImplement program changes through executive or legislative action to adopt a framework of requirements — similar to those enacted at the federal level — that support telework as a viable workforce strategy for the City. At a minimum the City should:\n\nassign responsibilities to Personnel and the departments to support and implement telework Citywide, even as the pandemic eventually subsides;\nformally incorporate telework into its emergency planning processes;\nrequire all departments to develop a telework policy that includes eligibility and participation criteria;\ndetermine telework eligibility and inform all workers of their eligibility; and\n\nprovide training to all employees and supervisors participating in telework to improve productivity and success.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the City of Los Angeles is responsible for delivering many different services to the public. These range from street sweeping and garbage pickup that come to residential homes, to YouthSource and WorkSource centers with walk-in access to a variety of resources such as job skills training.\n\nIn addition, the City has made strides in recent years to put content online and expand its digital presence. Although the availability and quality of the City’s digital services vary from one department to the next, the number of services have grown to include:\n\ndigital library services and its large collection of electronic media, including e-books, streaming options for movies and music, and online learning resources;\nonline application for business registrations with the Office of Finance;\npermit application, plan check review, and payment through the Department of Building and Safety’s ePlanLA online platform;\nMyLA311 website and mobile application to request certain services such as bulky item pickup and graffiti removal; and\ndata portals, including Open Data and ControlPanelLA, to share the City’s data.\n\nThese services are provided by over 40 different departments and bureaus, each with their own processes, priorities, and capabilities. Supporting these departments is the Information Technology Agency (ITA), which provides both direct IT support and consulting advice to other City departments on their technology projects.\n\nHowever, the City still has a long way to go. Many City services still require paper forms or in-person service delivery and COVID-19 threatened the City’s ability to deliver these same services. Suddenly, old processes, such as some payments and applications, that were still conducted on paper or in person could no longer function normally under social distancing limitations.\n\nIn the wake of COVID-19, the City’s responsibilities have also grown, as City employees are now coordinating virus testing, delivering meals to the homes of older adults, and operating emergency homeless shelters. Although COVID-19 will still have an outsized impact on the availability of some City services for the foreseeable future — such as for the zoo, public arts, parks and trails — investments in innovation and technology proved crucial for keeping certain services open during the pandemic.\n\nTo respond to this crisis, various departments throughout the City adopted new solutions to modernize processes and meet emerging needs. And while these technological efforts by individual departments are encouraging, a persistent issue in the City is the need for a more strategic approach. Other voices within the City, such as from the Innovation and Performance Commission, have also recognized this need to collaborate or expand existing efforts to improve the City. To this end, the commission has advocated for a Paper Free LA and to extend telecommuting across the City, while also voting to fund various pilot programs that are now demonstrating their value.\n\nThe City’s Digital Services Expanded During COVID-19\n\nWhile calls for government innovation are constant, actual change is often incremental. Delivering change requires consensus building and resources, both of which take time and effort. However, COVID-19 has caused a burst of innovation in the City, accelerating the roll out of new programs and spurring the adoption of technologies at a fast rate. These and many more ideas deserve recognition because they demonstrate the City’s ability to quickly adapt and meet the needs of its constituents.\n\nTo highlight the City’s efforts to keep its public-facing services open, a selection of projects are presented below.\n\nThese new services, combined with existing digital services, have proven their worth as investments as they expand the number of service options while also facilitating continued civic engagement during COVID-19.\n\nTelework Rapidly Expanded to Ensure Service Continuity\n\nPrior to March 2020, fewer than 30 City employees formally participated in the City’s telecommuting program, which allowed staff to work from alternative locations other than their primary office. This quickly changed as COVID-19 was becoming a worldwide pandemic. On March 4th, the City declared a local emergency and found itself needing to balance the continuation of essential services with the protection of employees and the risk of spreading COVID-19. On that same day, City Council directed ITA and the Personnel Department to rapidly increase the City’s telework capabilities.\n\nIn response, ITA acquired new software and developed new protocols to facilitate secure remote computer access, while the Personnel Department developed a new set of telework procedures to prepare the City for the wide adoption of telework. These efforts, combined with existing investments in cloud platforms to host IT systems online, also enabled the City to quickly switch to telework. By March 19th — the day the Mayor issued the Safer-at-Home order — the City was able to support over 10,000 employees working remotely from home with the option to expand further as needed. Since then, about 50 percent of the City’s civilian workforce has worked from home in some capacity.\n\nCONTINUING THE CITY'S DIGITAL SERVICES MOMENTUM\n\nOne of the many lessons learned from the City’s response to COVID-19 should be that smart investments in digital services and IT infrastructure have proven their worth. However, COVID-19 only accelerated this trend. Studies have shown that, more than ever, citizens expect high quality digital services from their governments.\n\nAngelenos are no different in their need for an engaging and effective experience with their government. By one measure, demand for digital services has exploded: service calls to the City’s 3-1-1 telephone number have remained steady in the last seven years, while other forms of service contacts to 3-1-1, particularly through the MyLA311 website and mobile phone  application, have more than tripled from 127,000 in 2013 to over 600,000 in 2019.\n\nTo meet this demand for more and better digital products, the City should continue the momentum generated by the crisis and expand its digital service offerings. As shown by the new and existing services provided by the City, developing more digital service channels can improve customer service, allowing residents to complete their transactions with the City in fewer steps and trips. \n\nRedesigning the City’s collection of websites to emphasize end-user needs can also improve customer experience, while removing online barriers to increase digital accessibility. Implementing simpler workflows facilitated by technology can also improve the City’s performance. Finally, new avenues for virtual interaction can improve civic engagement for City processes that require or should have public input.\n\nAt the same time, the benefits of online services are contingent on having ready access to computers and the internet. Recent surveys in 2019 show that a digital divide still persists, with over 40 percent of low-income Americans lacking access to either a home broadband connection or a computer, compared to over 90 percent of high-income US households who do have access. Studies within LA County also show a similar gap in access, especially in lower-income areas like South LA. In addition, COVID-19 has only shed more light on this critical issue, with 87 percent reporting that the internet has been “important” or “essential” during the coronavirus outbreak. \n\nHowever, digital inclusion programs can help reduce these barriers to access. One such program is the City’s OurCycle LA project, which seeks to close the gap by providing computers to participants in underserved communities. The City has also explored various options to provide high-speed internet access to low-income Angelenos but has yet to find a workable solution. More programs like these are needed as the City continues developing more digital services.\n\nThe City Should Do More to Expand Its Digital Service Offerings\n\nCurrent and emerging technologies continue to offer new frameworks to reshape how the City delivers its core services. As demonstrated by its response to COVID-19, the City is capable of adopting new technologies when unforeseen circumstances require it to do so. Many City departments were pushed outside of their comfort zones during COVID-19 and expanded what they thought was possible when it came to service delivery. \n\nAs the City gradually moves towards re-opening, our difficult fiscal environment also means that we must do more with less. Technology can help by empowering City employees to meet increasing demand while focusing on work that is valued by the people we serve. Although the Mayor’s recent Executive Directive 29 is a step in the right direction and also advocates for more digital and contactless government services, more needs to be done. To this end, department leaders should continue to evaluate how their services are currently offered, how customers access services, and how to create new digital services and improve existing ones. \n\nSome City processes still involve receiving and issuing paper – Despite prior efforts to reduce paperwork, some of the City’s public-facing services have not evolved beyond receiving paper because the logic of paper workflows still dictate its processes. Though paper will always play a role in City operations for reasons related to customer preference and accessibility, digital alternatives should exist. In addition, paperwork reduction for efficiency and environmental purposes need to be a top priority moving forward.\n\nCOVID-19 has demonstrated why digital service options should exist, as the closure of public counters has limited the number of options available to the public. This has forced the City to implement solutions that are less than ideal or secure, such as designated drop-off/pickup locations for customers to submit permit applications, planning documents, and payments for fees. Electronic or digital options, especially for processes such as payment, should already be widely available for the public.\n\nEven in cases where some departments have switched to receiving documents via email, the minor improvements offered by a fillable electronic application are lost when the applicant has to print the form out to provide a hand-written ink signature and when a City employee has to re-enter that same information into a database. \n\nHowever, online forms have long existed and can eliminate duplicative data entry. In addition, if more departments adopt the electronic signature platform used by ITA and integrate it with its forms, the City will be able to move beyond wet ink signatures. \n\nIn addition, several public-facing services also involve issuing “paper” products, such as hang tags for residential parking permits and business registration certificates. However, these paper products only serve to transfer the actual core service being provided. In the case of residential parking, permits signify the City’s approval for residents to use streets near their homes for long-term parking, and are part of a system for protecting access to street parking. \n\nReplacing these paper products with electronic equivalents could save on costs and provide greater convenience for the City’s customers. For example, the cities of Boise, Idaho and Beverly, Massachusetts adopted electronic parking permit systems and processes. Boise and Beverly are now able to instantly issue e-permits based on car license plates and eliminate the need to mail physical permits. Boise has even coupled its e-permit parking system with license plate recognition technology to more efficiently and effectively enforce parking access.\n\nVirtual interactions offer new service options – Replacing traditionally in-person services with virtual experiences is now a viable option for many City services. The Fire Department has already set this precedent with its use of drones to monitor and enforce brush clearance requirements and minimize fire hazards. \n\nAll City departments with field inspection functions should also explore the possibility of virtual inspections to supplement their current operations. Although it may not be appropriate for every situation, virtual inspections can provide City inspectors with eyes in the field without the need for boots on the ground. Beyond the need to reduce interpersonal contact, using virtual inspections can save travel time and costs, reduce the total time needed for inspections, and benefit customers by allowing inspections to be more precisely scheduled.\n\nMany other cities and counties throughout the country have allowed certain types of projects to qualify for virtual inspections. For example, Los Angeles County offers virtual inspections for a variety of projects including installations for water heaters, solar energy systems, electrical panel change outs, and re-roofs. In addition, Atlanta has begun conducting virtual building inspections for fire and life-safety requirements. \n\nLooking to the future, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) technologies that create new environments may also have a place in City government. Already, research is showing how urban planners can use VR and AR to create an immersive understanding of proposed designs and expand participation from affected communities. In addition, other VR and AR applications for firefighting and training hold the potential for rapid adoption.\n\nA Digital Services Strategy and Unit Could Provide Leadership For the City’s Ongoing Digital Transformation\n\nAlthough there are many ways to develop digital service options, the City also has many services already available online. The City’s MyLA311 service directory lists over 1,200 different entries, ranging from informational only, to departmental websites where services can be requested, to being able to create a service request within MyLA311 itself. However, many of these digital services were created by different departments to meet the specific needs of their own customers, sometimes resulting in confusion when related services are not well integrated.\n\nFor example, contractors and other members of the public may have relatively simple projects that only require a permit from the Department of Building and Safety, which can be obtained online through its Express Permit or ePlanLA systems. But undergoing a more complex building project, such as a major renovation for a new business, may require applications and permits from many other departments, including:\n\nBureau of Engineering (Public Works);\nBureau of Sanitation (Public Works);\nBureau of Street Lighting (Public Works);\nBureau of Street Services (Public Works);\nCity Planning;\nFire Department; and\nTransportation Department.\n\nWith the exception of the Bureau of Street Lighting, each of these other departments still have their own application, review, and payment processes outside of ePlanLA. Although Building and Safety is currently working with other departments to incorporate their permitting services into ePlanLA, the current lack of a unified online permitting system and process means that contractors and other customers must continue navigating through the City’s disjointed development process. \n\nEven submitting a claim for a refund suffers from fragmentation. Although refunds are processed by individual departments that received the payment, all claims must go through the City Clerk’s office to receive a claim number for filing purposes, providing a common point of entry for the City. \n\nHowever, BuildLA — the City’s single online portal for various building and development services — shows a different listing for claiming a refund from each of four departments. Each of these listings also lead to different claim forms, only one of which is an online intake system that allows the customer to file a claim, upload documents such as receipts, and check on the status of the claim.\n\nThis is just one example of a digital design and development approach that reflects the City’s organizational priorities for designating responsibility. Designs like this do not emphasize a customer’s priority of getting something done, like obtaining a refund, regardless of which department processes the claim. For constituents navigating these bureaucratic hurdles, the City can feel like a series of departments rather than a unified organization, leading to frustrating experiences that can undermine trust in the City’s ability to deliver on its promises. \n\nOverall, this points to the lack of a unified strategy for providing digital services in the City. Autonomous departments can pursue their own objectives independently, and prioritize developing and designing online services to meet their own needs. However, there may be lost opportunities to provide integrated services and a seamless customer experience in the overlap between departments. \n\nFortunately, a model already exists to help the City meet rising expectations for more and better digital services. Following the federal government’s failed launch of the healthcare.gov website in 2013, agencies such as the U.S. Digital Service and Technology Transformation Services were created to advise other federal agencies on digital transformation initiatives and develop web design standards to be adopted by agencies. \n\nIn addition, states and local governments throughout the country have begun adopting a digital services strategy and establishing digital services agencies to lead their efforts. For example, San Francisco published its digital services strategy in 2016. The planning document was the result of a lengthy effort to understand how various departments interact with the public in providing its services, the problems faced during those interactions, and the internal hurdles within the government to deliver better services. \n\nIn publishing its strategy, San Francisco arrived at a shared vision that:\n\nrecognized the need to put residents first in the design of services;\nwanted to offer integrated services and an improved customer experience; and\nwanted to deliver those services digitally whenever possible.\n\nThe strategy also provided a high-level implementation roadmap, which included establishing a new digital services team that was empowered to lead the City’s efforts. Several years after adopting its strategy, San Francisco now has a digital services team with over 35 members. The team has begun a major overhaul of its collection of city websites. In addition, San Francisco is developing a digital permitting system from the ground up that unifies all building permit work from various departments into one online platform. \n\nThe idea of a digital services team is not new to the City. In 2015, the City’s Innovation and Performance Commission provided $150,000 in one-time funding for a digital services unit pilot program. The pilot was led by the Mayor’s Office in collaboration with ITA and resulted in the creation of several new digital products. More importantly, the digital services pilot also offered valuable insights for the City, including:\n\nthe recognition that many digital services in the City were produced and designed without coordination or alignment;\nthe need for a longer-term strategy around the City’s digital services, especially to improve user experience and adopt best practices; and\nthe fact that solutions needed to be embedded within the City’s structure in order to be sustainable, such as by supporting and catalyzing ITA’s efforts.\n\nIn order to move its digital transformation forward, the City should apply the lessons learned from its experiment with a digital services unit and develop a longer-term digital services strategy. To address the need for better coordination and alignment, the strategy should be developed by a working group of departmental representatives. City organizations such as the Information Technology Oversight Committee or the Information Technology and General Services Committee may be an appropriate starting place for organizing these efforts and ensuring that the plan is ultimately implemented. However, the strategy should include input from members of the public to ensure that the strategy is centered on customer and end-user needs. \n\nThis planning effort should also deploy interviews, surveys, and focus groups, to develop a map of the City’s successes, challenges, and needs for implementing digital services, including digital equity issues. The strategy should result in shared goals for the City’s digital services and provide a high-level roadmap for implementation, which should include consideration for a new governance structure to sustain cross-departmental collaboration, and a dedicated digital services unit to provide leadership and implement the strategy.\n\nLong-Term Changes Are Needed To Sustain Telework\n\nAlthough the City has had a telecommuting program since 1994, departments seldom offered it to employees prior to COVID-19, and rarely considered its usefulness as a workforce management option. The rationale behind not implementing telecommuting widely likely mirrors the reasons offered by private sector employers, such as the inability to oversee employee productivity and reduced communication and collaboration with colleagues. \n\nHowever, the City’s forced experiment with working from home has demonstrated that telework can be a viable workforce strategy that strengthens departmental operations when properly implemented. The City’s new teleworking infrastructure, combined with existing investments in online cloud platforms, appropriate training on remote work tools, and new supervisory practices has enabled much of the City’s workforce to continue working during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has made the City more resilient to emergency disruptions in general. \n\nIn addition, studies have shown many other potential benefits that the City should take advantage of with a more robust telework program. For example, the Personnel Department’s own Citywide survey found that more than 90 percent of City employees and their supervisors believed that their productivity had either stayed the same or increased since they started working from home.\n\nAlthough telework research typically uses surveys of employees and supervisors to support the notion of increased productivity, one study actually measured it and found a 13 percent performance increase among teleworkers during a nine month experiment. The same study found an even higher performance increase (22 percent) among study participants who chose to continue working from home after the experiment ended. \n\nHowever, telework studies also show that there is no single telework arrangement that is appropriate for all situations. For example, one study found that doing dull and repetitive tasks negatively impacted teleworking productivity while performing creative tasks resulted in an increase in performance. Depending on the type of work and the need for collaboration, personal preferences, and home situation, some employees may thrive in a work-from-home environment, while others may not find telework to be suitable for them in the long-run. \n\nIn addition, the business needs of an organization or a particular job position can result in many different telework frequencies, including:\n\nfull-time telework;\na mix of days in the office and routinely scheduled days at home;\nsituationally for emergencies only; or \nto accommodate certain needs on a case-by-case basis\n\nGiven the complexities of formulating a workable approach to telework, the City should learn from the federal government’s leadership in telework practices. Even prior to COVID-19, 22 percent of the federal civilian workforce participated in telework on either a routine or situational basis in 2018, while 42 percent were eligible to participate. \n\nThe federal government’s preparedness is the result of laws passed by Congress, which includes several key features that provide institutional support for telework and promote it as a workforce strategy.\n\nMost importantly, these requirements shifted the onus onto agency management to develop a plan for how their organizations would use telework. Federal agencies still retained discretion for defining workforce eligibility and participation criteria in their policies. However, the requirement to develop a policy — even one that limits telework to situational uses such as declared emergencies — meant that management had to determine when and how telework would fit into their organization’s operations.\n\nThis differs from the City’s telecommute program prior to COVID-19, where departments were not required to develop a policy for using telework. This lack of institutional support meant that City employees had to advocate for their own telecommuting arrangements, while few departments had prior knowledge on how to manage their workforce outside of the office. \n\nTo implement telework more sustainably, the City should follow up by adopting a framework of requirements and best practices modeled after the federal government’s successes. Doing so will help to ensure that the City is better prepared for the next emergency, while also leading to improved air quality, better recruitment and retention of talent, reduced real estate and office management costs, and foster greater workforce flexibility and productivity.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nCOVID-19 has created a new normal that the City is still navigating. However, that new reality is also one that includes more digital services than ever before. The City has demonstrated its ability to adapt and should continue rethinking its processes and creatively using technology to improve its customer service for all Angelenos. To build on these existing efforts, the recommendations in this report serve as a guide for developing a collaborative digital service strategy. In addition, the City support for telework as a workforce and business continuity strategy hinges on its adoption of the recommended best practices.\n\nRecommendation #1\n\nConsider developing and adopting a digital services strategy that includes the City’s overall vision, objectives, and plan for providing digital services for the public. At minimum, the strategy should include:\n\ncreating or designating a working group or committee to guide the strategy’s development, consisting of staff from City departments, Council, and Mayor’s Office to promote collaboration and accountability;\ndeveloping shared values and goals for the City’s digital services based on the successes and challenges of implementing services online. This effort should also include significant public input to address digital equity issues and the needs of the City’s customers and end-users; and\nestablishing a high-level road map for achieving its goals, which should include consideration for a new governance structure, such as a committee that is empowered to prioritize and oversee digital service projects and promote collaboration across the City, and the need to create a digital services unit within the City that is dedicated to providing digital leadership in the City and implementing its strategy.\n\nRecommendation #2\n\nImplement program changes through executive or legislative action to adopt a framework of requirements — similar to those enacted at the federal level — that support telework as a viable workforce strategy for the City. At a minimum the City should:\n\nassign responsibilities to Personnel and the departments to support and implement telework Citywide, even as the pandemic eventually subsides;\nformally incorporate telework into its emergency planning processes;\nrequire all departments to develop a telework policy that includes eligibility and participation criteria;\ndetermine telework eligibility and inform all workers of their eligibility; and\nprovide training to all employees and supervisors participating in telework to improve productivity and success."

Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\n\nSeptember 9, 2020\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Michael Feuer, City Attorney\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: Meeting the Moment: An Action Plan to Advance Prop. HHH \n\nBy overwhelmingly approving Prop. HHH in 2016, Los Angeles’ voters authorized City officials to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds with the aim of reducing homelessness by acquiring, developing, or remodeling supportive housing and facilities, including interim housing, restrooms, showers, health clinics and storage. The measure provided for citizen oversight and a yearly financial audit by the City Controller. My office first examined HHH in October 2019 and recommended reallocating funds to lower-cost projects and streamlined permitting.\n\nOver the last year, homelessness in the City of Los Angeles jumped to 41,290 according to the 2020 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, up 16 percent from 2019 and 45 percent since 2016. Deaths among the unhoused population climbed almost 100 percent over seven years, with 1,047 people dying on the streets in 2018 alone. And COVID-19 has caused outdoor health and safety conditions to deteriorate further. While these facts illustrate the depth of the humanitarian emergency, they also reveal how one of the City’s primary tools to address it is coming up short. My latest audit reassesses the current HHH strategy and recommends a short-term action plan to utilize the remaining bond funds and provide more immediate relief to people experiencing homelessness.\n\nTime, costs still rising\n\nToday, more than three years after the first bond issuance and nearly four years since HHH’s approval, only three bond-funded supportive housing projects are open. There are 5,522 supportive units and 1,557 additional units in the pipeline, but 73 percent are not yet in construction. An additional 975 supportive units are being developed through the HHH Housing Challenge. The City also funded 24 interim housing projects and facilities with $58 million from HHH — a deliberately limited amount to focus on supportive housing.\n\nMy office’s 2019 audit uncovered that supportive housing projects typically take three to six years to complete from concept to occupancy. COVID-19’s impact on these already lengthy timelines is not clear, but will almost certainly extend them, and it is possible that some projects in the pipeline today may never come to fruition. Before the pandemic hit, the City had already granted time extensions for 15 projects in pre-development, ranging from 42 days to more than one year, because of permitting problems, financing complexities and lawsuits. Not only do delays slow projects down, they also increase development costs.\n\nBased on present estimates, 81 percent of units will not be completed until at least January 1, 2022, with 57 percent unavailable until 2023 or later — seven years after the bond’s approval. Supportive housing is considered the best long-term strategy to help chronically homeless individuals get back on their feet, but HHH’s lagging progress could leave that population without stable shelter options for years to come. Even when every HHH unit is completed, tens of thousands of Angelenos will still require housing — highlighting the need for a more strategic and flexible approach to utilizing remaining HHH funds.\n\nNot only are HHH timelines out of step with the demand for housing, rising program costs are as well. For projects in construction, the average per-unit cost increased from $521,000 in 2019 to $531,000 this year, with the highest per-unit cost reaching $739,000. And the share of units costing more than $600,000 spiked from 10.8 percent in 2019 to 28.5 percent today. Similarly, one-third of the units in pre-development will exceed $600,000, and per-unit averages increased from $507,000 to $558,000 in the past year. The highest total development cost for a single project in pre-development now surpasses $76 million.\n\nShort-term action plan needed\n\nOur most vulnerable residents are suffering concurrent crises and deserve a housing strategy that addresses this reality. Although the City has a plan to use the remaining $30 million in HHH funds, along with any money returned due to unsuccessful supportive housing projects, it would simply replicate the status quo by starting the development process all over again. Instead, City leaders should pivot to a viable plan that would spend available HHH dollars in these ways:\n\nBuild more interim housing and facilities: Stopgap measures will not end homelessness but will get thousands of people off the streets more rapidly while supportive units are built, and help meet health, hygiene, sanitation and storage needs.\nPrioritize adaptive reuse: The City should pursue alternative development strategies that could prove cheaper and faster to complete, including acquisition, rehabilitation or adaptive reuse of existing buildings, like hotels/motels, and unused commercial and office space.\n\nAdopting a short-term action plan will add flexibility to the HHH program, ease suffering for the unsheltered population and help the City achieve its long-term, voter-mandated goals — adding housing to improve people’s lives while reducing homelessness in Los Angeles.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nIn November 2016, more than 77 percent of voters in the City of Los Angeles approved Proposition HHH. The ballot measure authorized the City to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds to acquire or build supportive/affordable housing and facilities such as interim shelters, restrooms, showers, storage, and service centers. The resounding approval of the ballot measure – and significant amount of funding – was an unequivocal commitment by Angelenos to tackle homelessness.\n\nProposition HHH requires the Controller’s Office to perform audits for each year in which bonds are outstanding or bond proceeds remain unspent. The financial audit for FY2019 did not identify any significant irregularities or improprieties related to Proposition HHH. We also continued to assess the City’s progress.\n\nOur previous review of Proposition HHH found that development costs for supportive housing were high (median cost of $531,000 per unit) and estimated project timelines (three to six years) were not aligned with the magnitude of the homeless crisis. Because most of the supportive housing projects funded through Proposition HHH were in the early planning stages, we recommended that the City should reallocate some funding commitments to projects with lower costs or to interim housing and other facilities.\n\nThis recommendation remains relevant. Nearly four years have passed since voters approved Proposition HHH and the need to pivot to a different direction continues to grow. Despite the City’s efforts to lower costs and shorten timelines, the current trajectory of the program falls significantly short of our increasing and immediate needs.\n\nOnly three projects have been completed with a total of 179 supportive units and 49 non-supportive units. There are still 5,522, but nearly 73 percent of these have not yet begun construction. The City is also aiming to develop 975 supportive units through the Proposition HHH Housing Challenge, but the projects have not yet begun construction.[3]\nBased on the City’s current projections – which may not fully reflect pandemic-related delays – only 19 percent of remaining units in the HHH development pipeline will be completed before January 1, 2022. Approximately 43 percent of total units are scheduled to be completed before January 1, 2023.\nMore than 28 percent of units in construction exceed $600,000 per unit. Proposition HHH funds do not make up the entirety of costs and projects are financed by a variety of other sources, including the State and federal government.\n\nProposition HHH is a key component of the City’s overall strategy to reduce homelessness, which consists of a broad range of policy reforms and programmatic responses by the City, County, and Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). Still, large numbers of Angelenos continue to fall into homelessness.\n\nThe point-in-time count conducted in January 2020 estimated that there were 41,290 people experiencing homelessness in the City of Los Angeles – an increase of 16 percent from the previous year.\nNearly 29,000 of these people were unsheltered and fighting to survive in tents, encampments, vehicles, and other locations.\nThe impacts of longstanding systemic racism continue – Black residents represent less than 9 percent of the City’s overall population while making up nearly 38 percent of the homeless population based on the estimated count from January 2020.\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health data indicates that more than 1,000 unhoused people will likely die this year – at least three lives lost each day. Their study found that that the average age at death was 51 for individuals experiencing homelessness, compared to 73 for the general population between 2013 and 2018.\n\nThis grim reality is further compounded by the fact that the annual homeless count was performed before the devastation caused by COVID-19. Since then, hundreds of thousands of residents have lost their jobs and households that were already struggling to make ends meet have had their wages reduced. The ongoing uncertainty about the economic recovery, additional federal assistance, and eviction protections are a dangerous combination for these residents and others with precarious housing situations.\n\nThe pandemic has been especially difficult for Black and Latinx residents in Los Angeles County, many of whom have pre-existing health conditions or work in jobs that cannot be performed remotely. According to age-adjusted morality rates reported by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health as of August 24, 2020:\n\nThe mortality rate for Black residents was two times higher than white residents; and\nThe mortality rate for Latinx residents was 2.7 times higher than white residents.\n\nThe overlapping issues described above – income inequality, lost wages, housing insecurity, disparate health outcomes – mean increased risk of homelessness for many of our most vulnerable residents. The City and State have taken steps in recent months to strengthen the safety net, but the overall impact of those efforts remains to be seen. Barring an unforeseen intervention, the situation is likely to further deteriorate and put lives in jeopardy.\n\nThe convergence of these generational crises makes it even more critical to get HHH-funded supportive housing units, interim housing, and other facilities built as quickly and inexpensively possible. But the current situation also raises larger questions about how to balance the City’s long-term objectives and available resources with the growing humanitarian emergency that we are facing.\n\nHow much HHH funds have been committed and spent?\n\nAs of August 2020, the City has “committed” $1.17 billion in Proposition HHH funds, which leaves approximately $30 million in remaining funds based on the maximum amount authorized by the ballot measure. But the funding commitments do not become contractual obligations until the City and housing developers formally execute loan agreements.\n\nTo reach that stage, housing developers who receive HHH funding commitments – which do not fully cover the cost of the project – are provided up to two years to close the remaining funding gap and obtain the necessary approvals (e.g., land use entitlements and building permits) to move forward. Developers who successfully navigate this phase (referred to as “pre-development”) close their loans with the City, complete tasks required by other funders, and begin construction. Actual spending of HHH bond proceeds does not occur until all of these steps have been completed and housing developers periodically submit requests for payment.\n\nAs of June 30, the City has formally awarded $330 million in loans for supportive housing and spent approximately $160 million on both housing and shelters/facilities projects.\n\nBy a significant margin, the committed funds have been set aside for supportive housing rather than shelters and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. This approach is driven by the City’s steadfast commitment to developing supportive housing, which is designed to provide a combination of housing and services to help people experiencing homelessness, especially those who have disabling conditions and have been unhoused for an extended period.\n\nWhat is the status of HHH supportive housing?\n\nSince our last report, three HHH-funded projects were completed and several projects moved into the construction phase. According to the City’s Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA), there are up to 14 projects which are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020. But a large share of the projects are still in the process of securing additional funding and obtaining approvals (i.e., pre-development).\n\nMany projects were delayed before COVID-19, but the situation placed additional strain and uncertainty on the affordable housing framework held together by the City, County, State, federal government, developers, lenders, and private investors. Important project components such as funding, costs, and timelines are being affected.\n\nOn average, nearly $9 million has been set aside for each project in pre-development. The current economic volatility increases the likelihood that some projects do not proceed to the construction phase. If this occurs, HCIDLA plans to solicit proposals for new supportive housing projects using funds that were intended for unsuccessful projects.  \n\nThe City also set aside $120 million in funding with the aim of developing 975 supportive housing units through the HHH Housing Challenge. These efforts were intended to identify different housing typologies or innovative financial models to reduce project costs and development timelines.\n\nThe City is in the process of awarding $78 million in  financial commitments for 652 units through the HHH Challenge. Preliminary estimates show lower costs ($425,122 per unit) and shorter development timelines – which are both encouraging compared to the non-Challenge projects. However, several of the developers are now pursuing federal tax credits due to delays on State funding. This shift is significant and may mean added time and costs as the projects move toward construction.\n\nHow much do HHH supportive housing projects cost?\n\nHigh costs associated with development of supportive housing are not unique to Los Angeles, and financing complexity and regulatory requirements make comparisons to market rate development difficult. Jurisdictions face challenges due to factors such as prevailing wage requirements, land use issues, policy priorities outlined by funders, and competition from private sector construction projects for labor and materials.\n\nAcross all projects, Proposition HHH funds make up around 25 percent of total development costs. The maximum allowable Proposition HHH subsidy for supportive housing was $140,000 per unit during the most recent funding cycle and $220,000 per unit for previous funding cycles.\n\nConstruction costs typically represent more than half of each project’s development cost and contracts are not executed until funds are assembled, land use issues are resolved, and Proposition HHH loans are closed. As a result, the construction costs associated with each project largely reflect the demand for materials and labor when the contracts were finalized. For example, the National Association of Homebuilders recently reported that lumber costs increased considerably since April 2020. The impact of this increase will likely be reflected in the cost of projects moving toward construction during this period.\n\nA closer look at the distribution of per-unit costs for projects in construction shows that the overall share of units with costs above $600,000 increased from 10.8 to 28 percent since we issued our last report in October 2019.[4]\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of units below $400,000 also increased. Notably, two projects in this lower cost range were conversions of existing motels. There are two additional projects in construction which utilize a rehabilityation/adaptive reuse approach and the cost per unit is close to or less than the other projects in construction.\n\nThis limited sample size and number of potential factors make it difficult to draw larger conclusions about these projects. However, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) analyzed affordable housing projects completed between 2011 and 2015 which were funded with one of the federal tax credits available through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) program. The study found that median per unit development costs for affordable housing projects were lower in rehabilitation projects compared to new construction. This gap appeared across a range of locations, including New York City, Chicago, and California.\n\nPotential cost savings could be partially offset by the higher cost of maintaining an older building. But our dire need for faster solutions and the State’s current efforts with Project Homekey (to be discussed later) are consistent with this approach.\n\nCurrently, nearly 33 percent of units in pre-development are estimated to exceed $600,000. It is unclear how much these projects will cost by the time they begin construction.\n\nWhen will supportive housing developed through HHH be available?\n\nAn ongoing challenge for the City is the inherent complexity and length of time required to successfully finance projects. Proposition HHH funds (in the form of loans) are intended to help developers get projects off the ground and compete for other sources of funding, often federal LIHTC tax credits. The City provides developers with a two-year window to secure the funding necessary to make projects financially viable.\n\nThe upside of this partial-funding approach is that it helps the City spread HHH funding across a larger pool of projects. The downside is that each additional layer of funding comes with its own set of policy priorities, application process, award timeline, and costs.\n\nDuring our last review, we learned that supportive housing projects typically take three to six years to complete (from conceptualization to occupancy). A significant portion of that timeline is consumed by the project financing process. The City could increase its HHH subsidy and thereby reduce the amount of time/effort needed to close a smaller funding gap, but the tradeoff would likely result in less units being built.\n\nBeyond challenges related to project financing, developers successfully navigate projects through multiple City departments to obtain the necessary land use approvals and permits to begin construction. In 2019, the City established a position (“HHH Concierge”) to increase the speed at which HHH and affordable housing projects move through the development pipeline. The City has not yet finalized performance metrics to measure the impact of these efforts.\n\nThe timeline for HHH projects is further challenged by the pandemic and will add to what is already a lengthy development process. Projects currently under construction must adjust to social distancing guidelines and projects in pre-development must navigate added uncertainty in terms of project funding. According to the City’s estimates, Angelenos in need of supportive housing will need to wait several years before the majority of units are completed.\n\nAn ongoing challenge for the City is the inherent complexity and length of time required to successfully finance projects.

The downside is that each additional layer of funding comes with its own set of policy priorities, application process, award timeline, and costs.[5]\n\nWhat shelters and facilities projects have been funded through HHH?\n\nThe City has funded a total of 24 projects using approximately $58 million in Proposition HHH funds. The limited scope of this effort was driven by the City’s decision to prioritize development of supportive housing. In 2018, the City Council voted to suspend a planned request for proposals (RFP) and another RFP has not been issued since then.\n\nBefore the facilities program was suspended, the Office of the City Administrative Officer (CAO) solicited project proposals from outside entities and Councilmembers seeking to develop facilities on City-owned property. Eligible projects included rehabilitation/expansion of existing sites or acquisition/construction of new sites. In addition, projects that enhanced existing facilities to improve service delivery or continue operations – such as retrofits to make buildings compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) – were also eligible.\n\nProjects funded by the City include a mix of shelters for survivors of domestic violence, transitional housing service centers, navigation centers, and health clinics. Most of the projects (19 of 24) were renovations to existing shelters and facilities rather than new construction. When completed, the projects will provide 196 new shelter beds.\n\nWhat should the City do?\n\nThe City is in the midst of overlapping crises that disproportionately impact our most vulnerable residents. The situation is likely to further deteriorate without significant federal assistance. These dire circumstances provide an opportunity to reflect on decisions that were made years ago and evaluate alternate paths that may still be viable.\n\nMany of the underlying issues contributing to the slow progress and high costs associated with supportive housing developed through Proposition HHH are inherently difficult to undo overnight. At the current trajectory, less than half of the 7,079 housing units still being developed using HHH funds will be completed by January 1, 2023 – at the earliest. Supportive housing is also being developed through the HHH Housing Challenge, but the timing of those projects is difficult to predict given their evolving status.\n\nThere are several non-HHH efforts that have been initiated in recent months to tackle homelessness and the pandemic. The City and County recently reached a multi-year agreement to fund 6,700 housing interventions. Key elements of the City’s plan are outlined below.\n\nProject Homekey – The State is making $600 million in grant funding available to local public entities so they can purchase and rehabilitate housing, including hotels, motels, vacant apartment buildings, and other buildings and convert them into interim or permanent, long-term housing. Nearly all of the funding ($550 million) is emergency assistance from the federal government and must be spent by the end of 2020.\n\nIf local jurisdictions provide $150,000 in matching funds per door, the State is willing to provide up to $200,000 in acquisition funding per door.[1] The City recently approved a plan to apply for $250 million in capital funding from the State and has set aside up to $150 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to meet the match requirement. The City aims to use the funds for up to 1,250 units and may need to allocate additional funding for rehabilitation/repair of the acquired properties. On a per-unit basis, the City’s estimated budget for this effort is $320,000 – which may represent a faster solution at a lower cost than most units developed through Proposition HHH.\n\nLAHSA COVID-19 Recovery Program – In June 2020, LAHSA presented a three-year plan which seeks $610 million in new funding to find housing solutions for the 4,000 high-risk homeless individuals who received temporary hotel/motel placements through Project Roomkey and the 11,000 individuals who were targeted for assistance but not placed. LAHSA is seeking to use multiple sources of funding (including the State funding described above) to acquire hotels/motels, lease market-rate units, and utilize shared housing units.\n\nThe City recently approved a plan to provide LAHSA with more than $97 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds over the course of four years. LAHSA is aiming to place 3,000 people in privately-owned rental units by providing rental assistance and case management services.\n\nInterim housing sites – The City’s recent plan includes funding estimates to acquire and deploy 740 interim beds, at least partially through the use of pop-up tiny homes (i.e., Pallet Shelters). The City’s current estimated capital cost per unit for the interim housing sites, which will be adjusted once contractors are selected, is approximately $46,000.\n\nEven if these initiatives meet their goals in a timely manner, there will still be thousands of unsheltered Angelenos. Each day they spend without housing or shelter puts them at greater risk of illness or death.\n\nGiven the overall timeline and costs for completing HHH-funded supportive housing projects, the question remains about how best to move forward. The City’s current plan is to use the remaining HHH funds (approximately $30 million) and any potential funds ($9 million per project) returned from unsuccessful projects to start the process anew and solicit proposals for new supportive housing projects – which are unlikely to be completed until 2025 or later.\n\nThe City should reconsider this plan. The issue is not whether the City should invest in supportive housing using HHH funds – the issue is whether the City should almost exclusively pursue an approach that frequently costs more than $600,000 per unit and takes up to six years to complete when there are 29,000 people suffering in the streets. Instead, the City should find other ways to use any remaining/returned HHH funds to deliver faster and less expensive projects that better balance our long-term goals with our short-term needs.\n\nFocus on interim housing and facilities – Interim housing is critical to helping get vulnerable people off the streets. Available and accessible facilities are also essential to helping people meet their basic health, hygiene, sanitation, and storage needs. Unfortunately, neither of these have been prioritized or funded at a scale that matches the needs of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to the City, State law prohibits using Proposition HHH bond proceeds on items such as equipment, tents or other non-permanent structures, or mobile hygiene facilities. But the City has full authority to fully fund the construction of interim housing and facilities on City-owned property, or acquire property and initiate projects. The City should consider using HHH funds to supplement its emerging effort to increase the supply of interim housing solutions.\n\nPrioritize acquisition, rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse opportunities – Another approach would be to pursue strategies that minimize the impact of issues such as land use challenges, the cost of new construction, and systemic issues related to complex project financing. Different approaches – such as acquisition, rehabilitation, or adaptive reuse of existing buildings funded by Proposition HHH bond proceeds – may help reduce costs and timelines, and add units at a far faster rate than the current pace (228 units in nearly four years).\n\nFunding currently available through Project Homekey is an opportunity for the City to acquire hotels/motels and other existing buildings that can be converted into interim shelters or supportive housing. Although the retrofits needed to make these buildings suitable for supportive housing will add time and money, the locations can be temporarily used as interim housing. In addition, this approach may help mitigate concerns about increased risk of COVID-19 transmission within congregate shelter settings. A potential option for the City would be to contribute available Proposition HHH funding to expand these efforts.\n\nSocial distancing has also raised larger questions about the future of commercial space such as office space and big-box retail stores. Although it is too early to determine whether any downward market trends – and the costs associated with potential renovations – make these projects financially viable, the City should work with subject matter experts to identify opportunities.\n\nShifting course through these strategies may increase the City’s ability to deliver supportive housing, interim housing, and facilities at a lower cost and faster rate. More broadly, it would help re-align a generational voter investment with our emerging and urgent needs.\n\n[1] The ballot measure required that at least 80 percent of HHH funds be used for supportive housing and facilities, and up to 20 percent can be used to develop affordable (i.e., income-restricted) units. Affordable units are intended to provide subsidized housing for low-income residents. Affordable units and onsite building manager units are referred to as “non-supportive” throughout this report.\n\n[2] See Appendix A for a copy of the FY2019 financial audit.\n\n[3] These projects are discussed later in this report and are not included in analyses unless specifically noted.\n\n[4] This analysis is not a one-for-one comparison – the August 2020 data includes additional projects and the outlier projects may simply reflect construction costs at the time those contracts were signed. Regardless, the snapshot provides an overview of the 30 projects currently in construction.\n\n[5] Projects/units were categorized by the date when they are estimated to enter into service.\n\n[6] In a shared living environment, the “door” corresponds to the number of rooms that will be occupied by different individuals/households.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn November 2016, more than 77 percent of voters in the City of Los Angeles approved Proposition HHH. The ballot measure authorized the City to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds to acquire or build supportive/affordable housing and facilities such as interim shelters, restrooms, showers, storage, and service centers.[6] The primary focus of the ballot measure was to use bond proceeds from Proposition HHH to augment the City’s non-HHH efforts and facilitate the development of up to 10,000 supportive housing units over the course of ten years. The effort was widely embraced by voters as a way to provide permanent housing solutions to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles.\n\nProposition HHH requires the Controller’s Office to perform audits for each year in which bonds are outstanding or bond proceeds remain unspent. The financial audit for FY2019 did not identify any significant irregularities or improprieties related to Proposition HHH.[7] We also continued to assess the City’s progress.\n\nOur previous review of Proposition HHH found that development costs for supportive housing were high (median cost of $531,000 per unit) and estimated project timelines (three to six years) were not aligned with the growing magnitude of the homeless crisis. The underlying causes for these outcomes were a mix of issues specific to building supportive/affordable housing, as well as frequent obstacles to building multifamily housing in Los Angeles. The City took a number of steps to address these challenges, but a significant amount of Proposition HHH funds were already conditionally awarded to project proposals submitted by developers.\n\nBecause many projects were in the early planning stages of development at the time of our last report, we sought to identify opportunities for the City to change course before it was too late. We recommended that City policymakers consider the following actions to reduce costs and shorten timelines.\n\nEvaluate the feasibility of reallocating some Proposition HHH funds that have been conditionally awarded – especially funds committed to expensive projects with outlier development costs. This may free up funding for projects with lower per-unit costs or for interim shelters and facilities.\nSupport the Proposition HHH Concierge’s efforts to streamline permitting and other processes to ensure that projects currently in the development pipeline are completed as quickly as possible.\n\nSince we issued those recommendations, the number of unhoused Angelenos grew significantly. The annual point-in-time count led by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) estimated that 41,290 individuals were experiencing homelessness in January 2020, an increase of 16 percent from the previous year. A closer look at the data shows the continued impacts of systemic racism in Los Angeles – Black residents represent less than 9 percent of the overall population while making up nearly 38 percent of the homeless population.\n\nNearly 29,000 of the City’s overall homeless population were unsheltered and fighting to survive in tents, encampments, vehicles, and other locations. Data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health shows that more than 1,000 unhoused people will likely die this year – at least three lives lost each day.[8] Between 2013 and 2018, the leading causes of death for individuals experiencing homelessness were coronary heart disease, accidental drug/alcohol overdoses, transportation-related injuries, and homicide. The County estimated that the average age at death was 51 for individuals experiencing homelessness, compared to 73 for the general population.\n\nProposition HHH is a significant component of the City’s Enhanced Comprehensive Homeless Strategy, which is a collaborative effort between the City, LA County, and LAHSA. The strategy includes a broad range of policy reforms and programmatic efforts to tackle homelessness. While strategies invariably take time to implement and evaluate, the data indicates that the crisis is further deteriorating and raises questions about the overall direction and impact of Proposition HHH.\n\nThe tragic picture outlined above is likely going to grow – the annual count was performed before the public health and economic devastation caused by COVID-19. From a public health standpoint, the pandemic has taken a serious toll – more than 225,000 cases reported and nearly 5,500 deaths in LA County at the time of this report. The pandemic has been especially deadly for Black and Latinx residents, many of whom have pre-existing health conditions and work in jobs that cannot be performed remotely. According to age-adjusted morality rates reported by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health as of August 24, 2020, the mortality rate for Black residents is two times higher than white residents. The mortality rate for Latinx residents is 2.7 times higher than white residents.\n\nThe economic fallout from the pandemic is also devastating. Entire sectors of the economy have come to a virtual standstill, and some will likely be transformed in the aftermath of COVID-19. For example, social distancing requirements are causing employers to rethink telework as a viable long-term option for some professions. A shift away from traditional office settings would mean less demand for workers who help support and maintain those buildings. Research shows that the City is down more than 200,000 jobs and these figures do not account for residents who remained employed but had their wages reduced. The disruption places added burden on individuals who can least afford it and those who are already struggling with high housing costs.\n\nThe City implemented measures such as a rent lottery for 50,000 low-income households, rent freezes for units covered by the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO), and a moratorium on evictions for renters who can demonstrate that they are unable to pay rent as a direct result of COVID-19. But these protections are limited and temporary – the threat of widespread homelessness remains. Researchers at UCLA estimate that, without additional action, tens of thousands of households in LA County are at risk of falling into homelessness as a result of post-pandemic evictions.[9] The State recently approved legislation to extend protection from evictions through January 31, 2021.\n\nThe convergence of these generational crises further emphasizes the importance of getting supportive housing units, interim shelters, and support facilities built as quickly and inexpensively possible. The full impact of COVID-19 on Proposition HHH-funded projects remains unclear, but each of the following components is being affected.[10]\n\nProject funding – Assembling funding from multiple sources to make projects financially viable is an inherently challenging task. The ongoing economic volatility creates uncertainty for private lenders/investors, thereby increasing the risk that projects do not move forward.\n\nA critical part of making projects viable are federal rental subsidies in the form of Section 8 housing vouchers. In 2017, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) committed to providing vouchers for up to 5,000 units developed through Proposition HHH and recently committed an additional 1,000 vouchers. But there are currently not enough vouchers to fund all of the units in the development pipeline.\n\nProposition HHH supportive housing projects also require operating subsidies so that service providers can provide tenants with resources such as case management services and medical, mental health, and substance use treatment services. The County committed to funding these services – primarily through sales tax revenue generated from Measure H – but revenue projections remain uncertain due to the economic downturn.\n\nConstruction costs – A regional slowdown in market-rate multifamily housing construction may drive down labor costs for Proposition HHH-funded projects due to increased competition among general contractors and subcontractors. However, potential cost savings may be offset by increased costs for materials due to disruptions to international supply chains.\nDevelopment timelines – The Mayor issued an emergency order (“Tolling Order”) which temporarily suspended deadlines related to the financing and pre-development activities necessary to develop or rehabilitate affordable and supportive housing.\n\nConstruction of multifamily buildings requires large numbers of workers in tight spaces. Shortly after the public health emergency was declared, the Department of Building and Safety (LADBS) issued social distancing requirements at construction sites. These changes are essential to protecting worker safety, but will likely slow down construction.\n\nAs of August 2020, no Proposition HHH projects have been cancelled as a direct result of COVID-19. But the uncertainty likely means additional delays, higher costs, and greater risk of unsuccessful projects. The City’s Housing and Community Investment Department (HCIDLA) plans to reallocate funds from unsuccessful projects by initiating a call for developers to submit proposals for development of new supportive housing.\n\nThis report provides a status update on progress made on Proposition HHH-funded projects and explores ways to use Proposition HHH funds to deliver assistance to the tens of thousands of homeless Angelenos suffering through these unprecedented crises. It is important to place the City’s efforts with Proposition HHH into broader context – other ongoing initiatives are discussed throughout the report.\n\n[7] The ballot measure specified that at least 80 percent of the funds must be used for supportive housing and facilities, and up to 20 percent can be used to develop affordable (i.e., income-restricted) units. Affordable units are intended to provide subsidized housing for low-income residents. Affordable units and onsite building manager units are referred to as “non-supportive” throughout this report.\n\n[8] See Appendix A for a copy of the FY2019 financial audit.\n\n[9] Steve Chiotakis, “More than 600 people have died of homelessness this year.

Retrieved from https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2gz6c8cv.\n\nPROPOSITION HHH STATUS\n\nThe City reports that approximately $1.17 billion  in Proposition HHH funds – nearly the maximum amount approved by voters – has been allocated as of August 2020[11]:\n\n$993 million for supportive/affordable housing developed through the traditional HCIDLA development pipeline;\n$120 million for supportive housing developed through the HHH Housing Challenge; and\n$58 million for interim shelter and facilities projects.\n\nThe City has not allocated the remaining $30 million in Proposition HHH funds, but plans to do so in the coming months.\n\nBy a significant margin, the City is directing funding to the development of supportive/affordable housing rather than interim shelters or facilities such as restrooms, showers, storage, clinics, or service centers. The City made this policy decision because it was consistent with the intent of the ballot measure and presented a permanent housing solution for people experiencing homelessness rather than temporary relief. But the ballot measure did not include any language that specified how much should be used for interim shelter/facilities versus housing.\n\nProposition HHH funding commitments for housing are conditional and are typically made early in the development process. Actual disbursement of bond proceeds does not occur formal loan agreements (i.e., contracts) are executed and housing projects are ready to begin construction. HCIDLA is tasked with reviewing invoices submitted by developers and approving payments.\n\nThe Office of the City Administrative Officer (CAO) oversees the development of shelters and facilities using Proposition HHH funds, which are made available as loans repayable through a service repayment agreement with a term corresponding to the useful life of the funded facility. Developers are facilities must periodically submit requests for reimbursement payments that are subject to review and approval by CAO staff.\n\nAs of June 30, 2020, the City issued two Proposition HHH bonds with a combined value of almost $363 million, formally awarded $330 million in loans for supportive housing projects, and spent approximately $160 million for housing and facilities projects. The City has not issued any Proposition HHH bonds since July 2018 but has tentative plans to issue a new bond sometime in 2021 (assuming the bond proceeds on hand continue to be spent at a similar pace).\n\nHHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE\n\nBy any measure, development of multifamily housing in Los Angeles takes lots of time and money. Building supportive/affordable housing presents its own set of challenges. Since our last report, the first three HHH-funded projects were completed and several projects moved into the construction phase. Three projects did not move forward due to a range of issues: one did not receive Council approval; a developer with an HHH funding commitment elected to discontinue the project; and another project became ineligible for HHH funding because the developer no longer had legal authority to build in the proposed location.\n\nExcluding completed units and potential units from the Proposition HHH Housing Challenge (discussed below), there are currently 5,522 supportive units and 1,557 non-supportive units in the development pipeline. However, nearly 73 percent of the units have not begun construction and are still in various stages of the pre-development (i.e., planning) process.\n\nHCIDLA estimates that three projects will begin construction in the near future and up to 14 projects will be ready for occupancy by the end of the calendar year. Should this occur, it would represent important progress and would expand the City’s overall supply of supportive housing. But the magnitude of our homeless crisis far exceeds the average number of housing units (66) being added with each project. Finding ways to quickly build at a significantly greater scale/lower cost is essential.\n\nProposition HHH Housing Challenge Program\n\nThe City set aside $120 million in HHH funds with the goal of identifying innovative housing typologies or non-traditional financial models (e.g., alternatives to federal tax credits) that can be used to reduce development costs and complete projects within two years of executing a funding contract. Developers did not have to demonstrate site control before applying for funds through the HHH Housing Challenge. The City aims to facilitate the development of 975 supportive housing units through this process.\n\nThe City is in the process of awarding $78 million in HHH financial commitments for 652 total units through the HHH Challenge. The projects include promising approaches such as a financing plan tailored for modular construction and use of alternate structural materials. Preliminary estimates show lower costs ($425,122 per unit), lower HHH subsidies for most projects, and shorter development timelines – which are encouraging compared to the non-Challenge projects.\n\nHowever, several of the developers are now pursuing federal tax credits due to delays on State funding. This shift is significant and may mean added time and costs as the projects move toward construction. Due to the evolving nature of these projects, they are not incorporated into the analyses throughout this report.\n\nCOST OF PROPOSITION HHH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING\n\nResponding to homelessness requires developing policy and program responses tailored around the needs of people experiencing homelessness. Some individuals need sustained rental assistance, while others have greater need for services. Supportive housing is intended to provide with subsidized housing combined with on-site services such as mental and physical health services, education and job training, and drug and alcohol treatment. Buildings developed through Proposition HHH have dedicated space for these services, such as offices and meeting rooms that contribute to overall project costs.\n\nThe Terner Center for Housing Innovation recently analyzed quantitative data and conducted stakeholder interviews to identify cost drivers associated with hundreds of affordable and supportive housing projects throughout California.[1] Their analysis focused on housing developments funded with a specific type of federal tax credit (9%) between 2008 and 2019. Although many of the City’s HHH projects are funded with a different type of tax credit (4%), the research provides valuable insight.\n\nProjects built in Los Angeles had total development costs (i.e., land, construction, and soft costs) of approximately $600 per square foot. The cost of projects in San Francisco was significantly higher during the same period, and projects built in the inland areas of the State had lower costs compared to Los Angeles.\nSupportive housing is typically more expensive to build compared to housing for seniors and families. One of the contributing factors is that the units are usually smaller in size and each have their own kitchen and bathroom, which both add costs.\n\nThe Terner study also cited the impacts of factors such as prevailing wage requirements, rising construction costs, funding complexity, and land use issues. The report presented a number of issues for further exploration, many of which were related to State policies (e.g., streamlined funding and building/environmental code regulations) and others that will take time to implement (e.g., promoting innovation in the construction industry and growing the construction labor force). Progress in these areas is essential and will require a sustained effort given the lack of affordable and supportive housing throughout the State.\n\nBut in this current moment, the City is left to make funding decisions about Proposition HHH before these important reforms can be carried out. Proposition HHH loans typically make up approximately 25 percent of each project’s total budget. The maximum allowable Proposition HHH subsidy for supportive housing was $140,000 per unit during the most recent funding cycle and $220,000 per unit for previous funding cycles. The remaining funding comes from a combination of private sources and other sources of taxpayer funds such as federal government, State of California, and LA County. Although the City does not bear the entire cost of these projects, it should seek to further minimize development costs and – to the greatest extent possible – avoid draining the overall pool of funds available for supportive and income-restricted housing projects. \n\nAll supportive and affordable units funded through Proposition HHH are subject to a 55-year affordability covenant to ensure that they are restricted to the target population. More than 51 percent of the units being developed using HHH funds are compact studios (typically < 500 sq. feet) and 33 percent are 1-bedroom apartments – all units must have a kitchen and full bathroom to function as supportive housing. Larger apartments being built are set aside for families experiencing homelessness.\n\nCost of completed HHH supportive housing projects\n\nSince we issued our last report, the first three HHH-funded projects were completed and will provide homes and supportive services to a mix of formerly homeless individuals, seniors, families, transition age youth, and individuals with mental health conditions. The average HHH subsidy for these projects was approximately $7 million.\n\nIt is important to note that these projects (and six others) were not initiated after the passage of Proposition HHH in November 2016. Instead, they were already in HCIDLA’s development pipeline and HHH funding was used at the latter stages of pre-development – rather than the first-in approach – to close funding gaps and move the projects toward construction. As a result, the costs and timelines associated with these projects may not be representative of other projects in the development pipeline.\n\nTo better understand how costs were distributed for the completed projects, we analyzed project budgets submitted to HCIDLA during the pre-development phase and organized the data into the categories outlined below. These budgets are a snapshot of total development costs (TDC) estimates at the time of application and evolve over time, but they provide general context about the various cost drivers. As shown in the chart, construction costs accounted for nearly 58 percent of total development costs.\n\nAs shown here, construction costs typically represent more than half of each project’s development cost and contracts are not executed until funds are assembled, land use issues are resolved, and Proposition HHH loans are closed. As a result, the construction costs associated with each project largely reflect the demand for materials and labor when the contracts were finalized.\n\nIn our previous report, we found that projects were incurring soft costs of approximately 35 percent for non-construction activities such as fees, insurance, and financing costs. HCIDLA explained that the difficult and lengthy process of assembling funding from multiple sources contributes to these costs, and that the soft cost ratio was consistent with research published by the United States Governmental Accountability Office (GAO) in 2018. The soft cost ratio for the three completed projects listed above (31 percent) was consistent with this level.\n\nCost of HHH supportive housing projects in construction\n\nThe average HHH contribution for projects in construction is nearly $9.4 million. The aggregate data reported by HCIDLA shows that average per-unit development costs for projects in construction increased slightly, and outliers at both ends continued to separate themselves.\n\nA closer look at the distribution of per-unit costs shows that the overall share of units with development costs above $600,000 increased from 10.8 to more than 28 percent.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the percentage of units below $400,000 also increased. Notably, two projects in this lower cost range were conversions of existing motels. There are two additional projects in construction which takes a rehabilitation/adaptive reuse approach and the cost per unit is close to or less than the other projects in construction.\n\nThis limited sample size and number of potential factors make it difficult to draw larger conclusions about these projects. However, the GAO analyzed affordable housing projects completed between 2011 and 2015 which were funded with one type of tax credit (9%) available through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC) program. The study found that median per unit development costs for affordable housing projects were lower in rehabilitation projects compared to new construction.[1] This gap appeared across a range of locations, including New York City, Chicago, and California. Potential cost savings could be partially offset by the higher cost of maintaining an older building. But our dire need for faster solutions and the State’s current efforts with Project Homekey (to be discussed later) are consistent with this approach.\n\nIn addition, HHH projects in construction with development costs below $500,000 have an average of 73 units, whereas projects with development costs above $600,000 have an average of 58 units. While the limited sample size and number of variables makes it difficult to draw larger conclusions, the difference in costs – and need for additional units – suggests the City should prioritize funding larger projects. \n\nIt should be noted that the analysis is not a one-for-one comparison – the August 2020 data includes additional projects and the outlier costs may simply reflect construction market dynamics at the time those contracts were signed. Regardless, the data snapshot provides additional context about the current project portfolio.\n\nThe cost breakdown of projects in construction was consistent with the completed projects, with slightly higher costs associated with land acquisition.\n\nCost of HHH supportive housing projects in pre-development\n\nThe average HHH contribution for projects in pre-development is nearly $8.9 million. The cost of projects in pre-development represent an estimate at the time project proposals are submitted to HCIDLA – typically years before they begin construction. After receiving a conditional letter of commitment, developers have two years to assemble funding, obtain land use approval, and navigate the City’s permitting processes. As a result, the estimates below are preliminary and will be subject to market forces when construction contracts are finalized.\n\nThe estimated cost per unit increased by more than ten percent for projects in pre-development. The lowest cost project reported in October 2019 (Vermont and Manchester) has been corrected due changes in how the project is tracked by HCIDLA and the State. The project is a multiphase family and senior development, and the second phase (62 units) is funded by Proposition HHH. Both phases of the project were previously tracked together because they shared other funding sources, but that approach unintentionally made the HHH-funded units appear to be less expensive.\n\nCost Distribution of HHH Units in Pre-Development\n\nCurrently, nearly 33 percent of units in pre-development are estimated to exceed $600,000. The National Association of Homebuilders recently reported that lumber costs increased considerably since April 2020 – it is unclear how much these projects will cost by the time they begin construction.\n\nESTIMATED PROJECT COMPLETION TIMELINES\n\nRecent events and continued uncertainty will almost certainly add to what is already a lengthy development process. Projects currently in construction must adjust to social distancing guidelines and projects in pre-development must navigate added uncertainty with their financing arrangements.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the City granted extensions for 15 projects beyond the two-year window provided by the conditional funding commitment. The extensions ranged from 42 to 397 days and were requested due to challenges such as City permitting processes, tax credit application timelines, and a CEQA lawsuit. Beyond taking longer to complete projects, delays will likely result in higher development costs in the form of interest on loans and holding costs on land.\n\nDuring our last review, we learned that supportive housing projects typically take three to six years to complete (from conceptualization to occupancy). We previously calculated the timeline by measuring the number of years from the date of the City’s funding commitment to the estimated completion of construction. For this report we measured the length of time from the City’s funding commitment to the estimated occupancy date. This methodology does not capture time spent acquiring land to build a project.\n\nUsing this approach, the three completed projects took approximately 2.8 years to complete. But these projects – and six others currently in construction – were already in HCIDLA’s development pipeline before Proposition HHH was approved in November 2016. Whereas Proposition HHH funds are typically “first-in” and developers have two years to secure additional financing, HHH funds helped developers of the initial group of projects close a financing gap and move toward construction.\n\nBased on the City’s current projections – which may not fully reflect pandemic-related delays – only 19 percent of remaining units in the HHH development pipeline will be completed before January 1, 2022. Approximately 43 percent of total units are scheduled to be completed before January 1, 2023.\n\nProposition HHH Concierge\n\nThe City received grant funding in 2019 from United Way of Greater Los Angeles to create and fund the Housing Crisis Response Team within the Mayor’s Office of Citywide Homeless Initiatives. The grant also provided funding for the establishment of an Affordable Housing Production Manager (also referred to as the “HHH Concierge”). The primary goal of the HHH Concierge is to increase the speed at which HHH and affordable housing projects move through the development pipeline.[4]\n\nThe HHH Concierge has been collaborating with developers and City departments to streamline processes in accordance with established legal requirements and troubleshoot issues on a project-by-project basis. These efforts have led to the City’s Department of Building Services (LADBS) establishing a dedicated case processing team focused exclusively on HHH/affordablehousing projects.\n\nThe City has not yet finalized performance metrics to measure the impact of these efforts. They are in the process of establishing baselines for each permitting process and plans to launch quarterly reports and a public-facing dashboard.\n\nINTERIM SHELTER AND FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe January 2020 point-in-time count found that approximately 29,000 – or 70 percent – of the City’s overall homeless population was unsheltered. This data was compiled before the onset of the pandemic and likely understates the actual number of unsheltered residents. Uncertainty about continued federal assistance, additional job losses, and temporary renter protections mean that hundreds of thousands of additional households are at risk of falling into homelessness in the coming months.\n\nThere are several non-HHH efforts that have been initiated in recent months to tackle homelessness and the pandemic. The City and County recently reached a multi-year agreement to fund 6,700 housing interventions. Key elements of the City’s plan are outlined below.\n\nA Bridge Home (ABH) program – Launched in 2018, the City’s primary strategy for emergency housing solutions has been through ABH. As of June 2020, 13 ABH projects with 933 beds were completed and in service. The City recently reported that it expects approximately 840 beds to open by the end of the 2020.\nHomeless, Housing, Assistance, and Prevent Program (HHAP) – The City received a one-time grant of approximately $117.6 million from the State in June 2020. The funds have been committed across several categories including operating costs for ABH locations, ABH construction costs, rental assistance and rapid re-housing, and public health and hygiene.\nProject Homekey – The State is making $600 million in grant funding available to local public entities so they can purchase and rehabilitate housing, including hotels, motels, vacant apartment buildings, and other buildings and convert them into interim or permanent, long-term housing. Nearly all of the funding ($550 million) is emergency assistance from the federal government and must be spent by the end of 2020.\n\nIf local jurisdictions provide $150,000 in matching funds per door, the State is willing to provide up to $200,000 in acquisition funding per door.[1] The City recently approved a plan to apply for $250 million in capital funding from the State and has set aside up to $150 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to meet the match requirement. The City aims to use the funds for up to 1,250 units and may need to allocate additional funding for rehabilitation/repair of the acquired properties. On a per-unit basis, the City’s estimated budget for this effort is approximately $320,000 – which may represent a faster solution at a lower cost than most units developed through Proposition HHH.\n\nLAHSA COVID-19 Recovery Plan – In June 2020, LAHSA presented a three-year plan which seeks $610 million in new funding to find housing solutions for the 4,000 high-risk homeless individuals who received assistance through Project Roomkey and the 11,000 individuals who were targeted but not placed in hotels/motels. LAHSA is seeking to use multiple sources of funding (including the State funding described above) to acquire hotels/motels, lease market-rate units, and utilize shared housing units.\n\nThe City recently approved a plan to provide LAHSA with more than $97 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds over the course of four years. LAHSA is aiming to place 3,000 people in privately-owned rental units by providing rental assistance and case management services.\n\nInterim housing sites – The City’s recent plan includes funding estimates to acquire and deploy 740 interim beds, at least partially through the use of pop-up tiny homes (i.e., Pallet Shelters). The City’s current estimated capital cost per unit for interim housing sites, which will be adjusted once contractors are selected, is approximately $46,000.\n\nEven if these initiatives meet their goals in a timely manner, there will still be thousands of unsheltered Angelenos. Each day they spend without housing or shelter puts them at greater risk of illness or death.\n\nProposition HHH Shelter/Facilities Program\n\nProposition HHH authorized the City to use up to $1.2 billion in bond proceeds to develop supportive and affordable housing, as well as facilities such as shelters, showers, restrooms, storage, clinics, and navigation centers. The ballot measure required at least 80 percent of HHH funds to be used on supportive housing and shelters/facilities and prioritized supportive housing, but it did not specify how to distribute funds between those categories.\n\nAlthough the supportive housing model (i.e., housing combined with services) is considered a best practice for addressing chronic homelessness, shelter beds and facilities fulfill a critical role in helping unsheltered individuals until housing becomes available. Decisions about how to balance these approaches depend on a range of factors such as available funding, existing housing and shelter inventories, project costs, public health conditions, the number of unsheltered residents and their service needs.\n\nThe City has funded a total of 24 projects using approximately $58 million in Proposition HHH funds. [16] The relatively limited scope of this effort was driven by the City’s decision to prioritize development of supportive housing. In 2018, the City Council voted to suspend a planned request for proposals (RFP) and another RFP has not been issued since then.\n\nEligible projects included rehabilitation/expansion of existing sites or acquisition/construction of new sites. In addition, projects that enhanced existing facilities to improve service delivery – such as retrofits to make buildings compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) – were also eligible. The shelter/facilities projects that were funded by the City fall into two broad categories based on the entity that proposed (i.e., sponsored) them, HHH award process, and funding model.\n\nNon-City-sponsored projects – The City solicited proposals from non-profit or private entities for shelters/facilities projects in two phases: (1) an expedited request for proposals (RFP) in February 2017 seeking shovel-ready projects ready to begin construction within a year; and (2) a conventional RFP in August 2017. Applicants needed to meet a series of criteria to be considered, including whether they had funding in place to operate the proposed shelter/facility.\n\nFunding for non-City sponsored projects was made available as loans repayable through service repayment with a term corresponding to the useful life of the project. The initial RFP did not establish a minimum or maximum funding amount, but the second RFP set thresholds at $100,000 and $3.5 million, respectively. In total, the City funded 20 non-City sponsored projects with approximately $33 million in HHH funds.\n\nCity-sponsored projects – The City also funded projects through processes outlined in its matrix for re-purposing City-owned properties (i.e., Asset Evaluation Framework). To initiate this process, Councilmembers identified specific City-owned properties they sought to re-purpose and requested that the CAO, Office of the Chief Legislative Office (CLA), Board of Public Works Bureau of Engineering (BOE), and LAHSA evaluate the construction costs and service funding needed to establish the proposed shelter/facility.\n\nUnlike the non-City-sponsored projects described above, the minimum/maximum funding thresholds did not apply. In total, the City funded four City-sponsored projects with approximately $24 million in HHH funds.\n\nThe table below provides an overview about the types of facilities funded with Proposition HHH funds. It is important to note many of these facilities have multiple functions. For purposes of this summary, we primarily used the same main categories listed by the City.\n\nMost of the projects (19 of 24) funded by the City are renovations of shelters/facilities already embedded in their respective communities. A total of 196 new shelter beds will be provided when these projects are completed.\n\n[11] Proposition HHH-related data for this report was obtained directly from HCIDLA, the City’s Proposition HHH dashboard (https://hcidla2.lacity.org/hhh-progress), City Council Files, and recurring reports submitted to the Proposition HHH Citizens and Administrative Oversight Committees.\n\n[12] Reid, C., Napolitano, A., Stambuk-Torres, B.

Retrieved from: https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-637.\n\n[15] The Mayor issued Executive Directive #13 (ED13) in October 2015 to facilitate streamlined and prioritized case processing for all affordable housing developments. Although it was issued before Proposition HHH, the strategies outlined within ED13 apply to supportive housing developments.\n\n[16] In a shared living environment, the “door” corresponds to the number of rooms that will be occupied by different individuals/households.\n\n[17] Two additional projects received funding commitments but did not proceed due to unanticipated costs. Another project did not move forward because the developer ran into issues converting single room occupancy (SRO) units to transitional housing.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe primary recommendation in our previous report called on the City to consider reallocating previously-committed HHH funds from expensive or stalled projects to projects with lower costs or development of shelters and facilities. These are inherently difficult decisions – but the results since Proposition HHH was passed in November 2016 need to be considered before electing to stay the course.\n\nOnly three projects have been completed (228 units) nearly four years after voters approved Proposition HHH. Approximately 73 percent of total units are still in pre-development and have not yet begun construction.\nBased on the City’s current projections, only 19 percent of remaining units in the HHH development pipeline will be completed before January 1, 2022. Approximately 43 percent of total units are scheduled to be completed before January 1, 2023.\nMore than 28 percent of units in construction exceed $600,000 per unit. Nearly 33 percent of units in pre-development are projected to exceed the same cost threshold, and will be subject to market forces when developers solicit bids for construction contracts.\n\nGiven the overall timeline and costs for completing HHH-funded supportive housing projects – and the magnitude of our overlapping crises – the question remains about how best to move forward. The City’s current plan is to use the remaining HHH funds (approximately $30 million) and any potential funds ($9 million per project) returned from unsuccessful projects to start the process anew and solicit proposals for new supportive housing projects – which are unlikely to be completed until 2025 or later.\n\nThe City should reconsider this plan. The issue is not whether the City should invest in supportive housing using HHH funds – the issue is whether the City should almost exclusively pursue an approach that frequently costs more than $600,000 per unit and takes up to six years to complete when there are 29,000 unsheltered Angelenos and an average of three lives lost every day in LA County. Instead, the City should find other ways to use any remaining/returned HHH funds to deliver faster and less expensive projects that better balance our long-term goals with our short-term needs.\n\nFocus on interim housing and facilities – Interim housing is critical to helping get vulnerable people off the streets. Available and accessible facilities are also essential to helping people living on the streets meet their basic health, hygiene, sanitation, and storage needs. Unfortunately, neither of these have been prioritized or funded at a scale that matches the needs of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles.\n\nAccording to the City, State law prevents the City from using Proposition HHH bond proceeds on items such as equipment, tents or other non-permanent structures, or mobile hygiene facilities. But the City has full authority to fully fund the construction of interim housing and facilities on City-owned property, or acquire property and initiate projects. The City should consider using HHH funds to supplement its emerging effort to increase the supply of interim housing solutions.\n\nPrioritize acquisition, rehabilitation, and adaptive reuse opportunities – Another approach would be to pursue strategies that minimize the impact of issues such as land use challenges, the cost of new construction, and systemic issues related to project financing. Different approaches – such as acquisition, rehabilitation, or adaptive reuse of existing buildings funded by Proposition HHH bond proceeds – may help reduce costs and timelines, potentially adding units at faster rate than the current pace (228 units in nearly four years).\n\nCalMatters obtained data from the California Hotel & Lodging Association that showed smaller hotel/motel properties in Los Angeles County may cost approximately $100,000 per unit to acquire, but would likely require additional time and money before they could be converted into supportive housing.[18] The City has explored the purchase or long-term leases of hotel/motel properties but encountered regulatory hurdles due to the need for zoning changes and a lack of interest from small business owners. However, those efforts mainly took place before the onset of the pandemic – the City may encounter a vastly different marketplace for these opportunities.\n\nFunding currently available through Project Homekey is an opportunity for the City to acquire hotels/motels and other existing buildings that can be converted into interim shelters or supportive housing. Although the retrofits needed to make these buildings suitable for supportive housing will add time and money, the locations can be temporarily used as interim housing and mitigate risks associated with COVID-19 transmission in congregate shelter settings. On a per-unit basis, the City’s estimated per unit budget in its application for Project Homekey funding is $320,000. A potential option for the City would be to contribute available Proposition HHH funding to expand these efforts.\n\nSocial distancing requirements have also raised larger questions about the future of commercial space such as office space and big-box retail stores. Although it is too early to determine whether any downward market trends – and the costs associated with potential renovations – make these projects financially viable, the City should work with subject matter experts to identify opportunities.\n\nShifting course through these strategies may increase the City’s ability to deliver supportive housing, interim shelter, and facilities at a lower cost and faster rate. More broadly, it would help re-align a generational voter investment with our emerging and urgent needs.\n\n[18] Matt Levin, “Converting a motel to homeless housing, step by step,” CalMatters, June 9, 2020, https://calmatters.org/housing/2020/06/motel-conversion-homeless-housing-california/."

At its core, gender equity is about making sure women and men have equal access to the same resources and opportunities for success. But equity is both different from and requisite to equality — which only works if everyone starts from a comparable place. The concept of equity, as compared to equality, takes into consideration the unequal nature of our society and its institutions, including the workplace.\n\nAccording to a 2018 Census Bureau study, women earn less than 82 cents for every dollar earned by men in the United States. This is an obvious matter of inequality, but to address and erase this gap will take more than dollars and cents — it will take rethinking and restructuring the way women are recruited, hired, promoted and paid, among other things. Only by paying attention to systemic inequities in all these areas will women eventually have a more leveled opportunity to become business leaders, tech CEOs and fire captains in cities across the country.\n\nThis is as true in the City of Los Angeles as anywhere in the nation. While women in California have achieved a slightly narrower pay gap than women in other states, and the City of Los Angeles has distinguished itself by taking affirmative steps to improve women’s access to better jobs and pay, there remains considerable room for improvement. My latest report addresses the issue of gender equity at the City by taking a closer look at the workforce, along with the corresponding pay of women overall and in each department.\n\nUnderrepresented and underpaid\n\nA payroll analysis completed by my office found that, despite the Mayor’s 2015 Executive Directive on “Gender Equity in City Operations,” which tasked all City departments with developing action plans to close existing gender gaps, and the Personnel Department’s efforts to recruit and hire more women into civil service jobs, the City has fallen short of its worthy goals. Women remain both underrepresented and underpaid when compared to their male co-workers.\n\nWomen currently represent only 28 percent of the City’s workforce — the same percentage as in 2015 and far less than similar jurisdictions in California and across the country. In addition, women working at the City earn, on average, just 76 percent of what men make and took home just 24 percent of the gross amount the City paid its employees last year. Most alarmingly, my office found that women earned nine percent of the $884 million in overtime paid by the City in 2019, with men earning $801.5 million, or 91 percent of all overtime. And only two of the 100 highest paid City of Los Angeles employees were women, with the remaining 98 top earners men.\n\nGender inequity is particularly pronounced in the City’s largest departments: Police, Water and Power, Public Works, Fire, Airports, Transportation and General Services. Women represent between seven and 34 percent of the workforce in these departments. When it comes to sworn workers, the numbers dip even lower: women are just three percent of sworn Fire Department employees and 18 percent of sworn Police Department employees, limiting access to thousands of high paying City jobs that also accrue significant overtime hours.\n\nPathway to progress\n\nWhile it is impossible to create gender equity overnight, the City must take additional steps to develop a more diverse and representative workforce, which will also help close the existing pay gap between women and men. My report makes the following recommendations:\n\nDevelop a strategic plan with clear goals to better recruit, hire, develop and retain women in departments across the City.\nCreate a working group of City officials and community and labor partners tasked with designing a clear pathway to help women participate in all job classifications and promotional opportunities, focused especially on higher paying jobs with access to overtime.\nRequire the largest City departments to submit annual reports on their efforts to attract more women to entry level jobs that traditionally have been dominated by men.\n\nI urge City leaders to adopt these recommendations to ensure that our City makes meaningful progress toward gender equity in the years ahead. By turning our intentions into action, the City can make a difference for our hardworking women employees and those we hope to recruit to the workforce in the future.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nConcerted efforts have been made to promote inclusion and remove institutional barriers; nonetheless, many employers across the country – including the City of Los Angeles – continue to fall short of achieving gender equity in the workplace. Closing the gender gap in government is especially important not only due to government’s unique role in shaping public policy, but because the City works for the people of Los Angeles, and its ranks should reflect the diversity of the community it serves.\n\nThe City has made improving gender equity a priority in recent years. The Mayor issued Executive Directive No. 11 (“Gender Equity in City Operations”) in August 2015 and tasked general managers with developing action plans to close existing gender gaps.  The Personnel Department evaluates gender balance each time a civil service job application is offered. When women are underrepresented, a Targeted Recruitment Plan is developed; these plans may include targeted advertising and outreach, as well as testing and evaluation techniques aimed at achieving better representation.\n\nDespite these efforts, the results have not come to fruition. The data shows that the City has significantly lower levels of women represented in the workforce as compared to other large jurisdictions.  Women also lag behind men in hourly pay and gross amounts earned, which include bonuses and overtime.\n\nWomen comprise only 28 percent of the City’s full-time workforce.\nWhen looking at gross annual pay, women averaged $90,058, compared to an average of $118,454 for men; in other words, the average woman’s paycheck is about 76% that of the average man’s paycheck.\nOf the top 100 highest paid employees, two were women. Those women were the Chief Legislative Analyst (23rd highest paid) and the General Manager of Los Angeles World Airports (28th highest paid). The highest paid City employee was a Chief Port Pilot.\nOverall, City employees received paid overtime totaling $884 million over an annual period. Men received 91% of that amount, or $801 million, while women earned a total of $82.7 million in overtime.\n\nThe magnitude of these disparities makes an overnight transformation impossible. This report, an analysis of payroll data is intended to provide a snapshot of the City’s workforce through the lens of gender equity and establish a baseline against which future programmatic efforts can be measured. We offer the following recommendations to City Leaders:\n\nDevelop a strategic plan with goals and strategies to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent pools and heighten the cultural competencies of City leadership and its workforce.\nRequire annual reports to be submitted by the Personnel Department, in conjunction with Police, Fire, Public Works, LADWP, Airports, Transportation, General Services, and Building & Safety, that formally document the City’s efforts to attract greater representation of women to entry level job classifications that have traditionally been male dominated.\nCreate a Working Group tasked with creating a pathway for women to better participate in all job classifications, promotions, the opportunity to earn overtime, and the ability to occupy the highest paying jobs. The Working Group would include members from the Community, Labor, CAO, and Personnel.\nWOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE\n\nThe data used for this report was primarily generated through the City’s payroll system (PaySR) and compared to publicly available data from other jurisdictions. It is important to note that the legacy PaySR system provides two gender choices – female and male. The City is transitioning to a new payroll system that has the capacity for additional gender choices such as non-binary.\n\nWith the exception of Exhibits 1, 6, 16 and 17, the information presented in this report does not include the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP), as LADWP uses a different payroll system from that used by all other City departments. Also, while most numbers and exhibits reference a point-in-time count for City employees at their various positions within Departments (as of December 2019), the gross pay and overtime analyses uses payroll data over a 12-month period. Since employees enter and exit the City workforce throughout the year, the total number of employees over the annual period (54,317)[1] is greater than the point-in-time count (49,417)[2].\n\nComparative Summary Data\n\nIn comparison to the publicly available gender demographics of other cities and counties, the City has the lowest representation of women in its workforce.\n\nIt is notable that the City of New York operates primary education and health care services; while the Counties of Los Angeles and San Francisco also operate health care services. Primary education and health care services tend to include a high level of positions that are traditionally held by women.\n\nWhen comparing the City’s sworn Police and Fire workforce to the County’s sworn Sheriff and Fire workforce, gender demographics are similar.\n\nTen Year Comparison of Workforce Gender Demographics\n\nThe total number of City employees decreased by about 5% over the last decade (40,349 in 2009 vs. 38,280 in 2019), as did the representation of women in the City’s workforce (31% in 2009 vs. 30% in 2019). Representation of women in the sworn workforce increased slightly from 14% in 2009 to 15% in 2019.\n\nThe current workforce is comprised of 63% civilian and 37% sworn employees. Sworn employees work at four City departments:  Police, Fire, Harbor and Airports.\n\nWhen separately evaluating the civilian and sworn workforce, there is greater gender diversity (60% men vs. 40% women) within the civilian workforce than the sworn workforce (85% men vs. 15% women) among these four departments.\n\nCurrent Workforce: Top Job Classifications\n\nAs of the end of 2019, 38% (14,644 of 38,280) of the City’s workforce was comprised of just six City job classifications. Of these, women filled the majority of the two civilian position series (Clerks and Analysts), but significantly fewer of four sworn positions (Firefighters, Police Officers, Detectives and Sergeants).\n\nGender Demographics of City Departments\n\nThe seven largest City departments include: Police, Water and Power, Public Works, Fire, Airports, Transportation, and General Services.  Representation of women in these departments ranged from 7% to 34%; with Public Works, Fire, LADWP and General Services having less than 25% representation.  Of the remaining City departments, only Building & Safety has less than 25% representation, with 197 of its 897 employees as women. A comprehensive look at all City Departments is included as an Appendix at the end of the report.\n\nFurther analysis of the largest job classifications at the following large City departments indicate that the traditionally male-dominated job classifications (e.g., equipment operators, wastewater collection, inspectors, engineers, traffic painter and sign posters, gardeners, firefighters, police officers, sergeants, detectives) continue to be represented by a majority of men and the traditionally female dominated job classifications (e.g., police service representatives (911 operators), administrative clerks, senior administrative clerks, management analysts and senior management analysts) continue to be represented by a majority of  women.\n\n—————\n\n[1] As of FY 2017.\n\n[2] As of FY 2020; includes full-time and part-time employees.\n\nHOURLY PAY, GROSS PAY AND OVERTIME\n\nHourly Pay\n\nConsidering all City departments (except LADWP) the average full-time City worker earns $46 an hour in regular pay[3]. Men average $47 an hour, while women average $44 an hour.\n\nSixty-five percent of the City’s workforce are earning an hourly pay range between $30 and $59, while 16% are earning an hourly pay range of $29 or less, and 19% are earning an hourly pay range of $60 or more.\n\nAs noted in the Appendix, on average, employees at Animal Services (324), the Zoo (231), and Recreation & Parks (1,399) receive the lowest hourly pay amongst all City departments at $32, $34, and $35, respectively; while employees working in the Office of Public Accountability (4), the Office of the City Attorney (982), and the City Administrative Office (116) receive the highest hourly pay at $86, $65, and $60, respectively.\n\nThe following chart paints a picture of the hourly pay ranges of women and men in the City.\n\nGross Pay Analysis\n\nOver the most recent annual period[4], 54,317 full-time City employees received almost $6 billion in gross pay. This includes regular hourly pay, bonuses, overtime, any adjustments that occurred during the year, and any payments for accrued leave at termination.  Of these City employees, 15,643 (29%) were women, who were paid a total of $1,408,774,609 (averaging $90,058); while 38,674 (71%) were men who were paid $4,581,097,937 (averaging $118,454).\n\nFocusing on the top 100 highest paid City employees for 2019, only two were women. Those women were the Chief Legislative Analyst (23rd highest paid) and the General Manager of the Los Angeles World Airports (28th highest paid).  The highest paid City employee was a Chief Port Pilot.\n\nPaid Overtime\n\nCity employees were paid $884 million in overtime earnings during the most recent annual period. The sworn employees of LAPD and LAFD earned 54% of that amount. It is interesting to note that only 9% of the total overtime paid was earned by women, including both sworn and civilians. Overtime earnings were most disproportionate for women at LAFD – Sworn; the Department with the lowest ratio of women employees, and with significant amount of overtime pay.\n\n—————-\n\n[3] Does not include overtime or supplemental pay, including some bonuses.\n\n[4] For LADWP employees, this is calendar year 2019; while for the remaining City departments, this is FY 2019-20.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nRecommendation #1\n\nDevelop a strategic plan with goals and strategies to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent pools and heighten the cultural competencies of City leadership and its workforce.\n\nRecommendation #2\n\nRequire annual reports to be submitted by the Personnel Department, in conjunction with Police, Fire, Public Works, LADWP, Airports, Transportation, General Services, and Building & Safety, that formally document the City’s efforts to attract greater representation of women to entry level job classifications that have traditionally been male dominated.\n\nRecommendation #3\n\nCreate a Working Group tasked with creating a pathway for women to better participate in all job classifications, promotions, the opportunity to earn overtime, and the ability to occupy the highest paying jobs. The Working Group would include members from the Community, Labor, CAO, and Personnel.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nInformation in this section is updated as of November 2019.

The City’s purchasing power presents a tremendous opportunity to invest in local small businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color, but Los Angeles is not as effective as it could be in connecting small businesses and businesses owned by historically disadvantaged groups to contracting opportunities. This report identifies ways the City of Los Angeles can better assist businesses and improve contracting equity.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nSupporting Los Angeles businesses – especially the diverse small business community – is essential as we work to recover from the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These businesses are especially vulnerable in the aftermath of an economic shock, and the City has taken proactive steps to connect local businesses with loans and other types of emergency financial assistance to help them keep staff employed, pay rent, and otherwise stay afloat.\n\nThe City can also help businesses recover and grow through the billions of dollars it spends each year on commodities, professional services, and construction. For years, the City has administered a range of programs to provide contracting opportunities to local businesses, small businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color.\n\nThe Business Inclusion Program (BIP) uses an outreach-based approach that is intended to facilitate the development of business partnerships between prime contractors competing for City contracts and potential subcontractors who meet specific demographic or business requirements.\nThe City’s local business preference programs offer bid discounts for firms based in Los Angeles County.\n\nThe overall design – and limitations – of the City’s efforts are shaped by its highly decentralized procurement framework, and legal requirements set forth in the California State Constitution and City Charter.\n\nThis report evaluates the City’s current approach and identifies ways that the City can use its contracting authority to invest procurement dollars in local, small, and disadvantaged businesses in Los Angeles. We concluded that the City should do more to harness its purchasing power to build an inclusive contracting community that fosters improved economic outcomes for Los Angeles businesses.\n\nThe City is Unable to Accurately Measure the Impact of BIP\n\nBIP was established in 2011 through Mayoral Executive Directive 14. BIP brings under one umbrella several business development initiatives that are intended to address contracting equity issues. The City issues or recognizes a variety of business certifications based on demographic characteristics (e.g., race, gender, disabled veteran) or business criteria (e.g., annual revenue, location of principal office, number of employees). The certifications are intended to acknowledge the challenges these businesses face when competing for government contracts.\n\nWhile the federal government and some state and local government agencies outside of California can develop race- and gender-conscious contracting programs to help women and people of color participate in government contracting, the City of Los Angeles is currently unable to develop programs using a similar approach. Proposition 209 (1996) amended the California Constitution and prohibited public agencies in California from using gender and race as a factor in contract awards.\n\nHowever, there may be opportunities to implement race- and gender-conscious procurement programs in the future. State legislators recently voted to place a ballot measure (ACA 5) before voters in November 2020 which – if approved – would repeal Proposition 209. Revisions to the City Charter to allow race and gender as a factor in contracting would also be needed, which requires citywide voter approval. In addition, the City would need to demonstrate contracting disparities before developing a narrowly tailored program to remedy those issues.\n\nIn anticipation of the potential repeal of Proposition 209, the Mayor issued Executive Directive 27, which requires departments to develop Racial Equity Plans, and initiates a citywide review of hiring and contracting data to identify racial disparities. The City Council has also introduced motions directing departments to explore new ways to support the inclusion of disadvantaged businesses in City contracting. While these are positive first steps, the City needs to address fundamental weaknesses in its business inclusion strategy.\n\nInclusion through outreach – At the core of BIP is the requirement for prime contractors competing for City business to carry out a series of outreach tasks to notify certified businesses about potential subcontracting opportunities. Prime contractors must demonstrate that they made a “good faith effort” in carrying out these tasks, including any negotiations with certified businesses who seek to fulfill a useful subcontracting role.\n\nPrime contractors communicate with potential subcontractors using the Los Angeles Business Assistance Virtual Network (LABAVN), the City’s online portal for advertising contracting opportunities and facilitating outreach between vendors. Prime contractors can be disqualified from a procurement for failing to conduct BIP outreach, but the City cannot compel them to partner with firms owned by women and people of color because of Proposition 209.\n\nThe BIP model – mandatory outreach and voluntary subcontracting partnerships – inherently limits the reach of the program. Prime contractors who believe that working with certified firms will make their bids less competitive – or see subcontracting dollars paid to certified businesses as foregone profits – are unlikely to bring in subcontractors. A frequent criticism of the program is that some prime contractors make “good fake efforts” without any intention of partnering with certified businesses.\n\nMoving forward, the City should weigh its options as it relates to the long-term direction of BIP and its potential to impact the local economy. But the City’s ability to make informed decisions about BIP is impeded by longstanding procurement challenges. Specifically, the City must discern the extent to which program design and implementation factors have contributed to BIP’s shortcomings.\n\nBIP program management issues – Since its inception, BIP has been hampered by the City’s decentralized procurement framework which delegates authority to each City department to manage its own procurement processes and records. This makes ensuring departmental compliance with BIP requirements – and measuring the program’s impact – extremely difficult.\n\nLack of a dedicated program manager – No single department or City official was actively managing the BIP program until the City hired its first Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) in 2018. The CPO plans to modernize BIP outreach with the eventual replacement of LABAVN. The new application is intended to operate as a virtual marketplace that will improve the ability of firms to match with one another and develop new business relationships. However, improving BIP is one of several procurement reform initiatives under the CPO’s purview. Furthermore, with a relatively small team of just three analysts, the CPO likely lacks sufficient resources to monitor on an ongoing basis departments’ compliance with BIP outreach and data reporting requirements.\n\nContracting managers in City departments are still responsible for day-to-day issues related to BIP administration, including evaluating prime contractors’ “good faith effort” and monitoring whether prime contractors are following through with subcontracting commitments.\n\nNo citywide analysis of BIP participation data in recent years – City departments are required to report BIP participation rates on a quarterly basis to the Office of the Mayor and a Small and Disabled Veteran Business Procurement Advisory Committee. But the Advisory Committee is now defunct, and departments do not regularly report business inclusion data.\n\nThe City also lacks a centralized procurement management system and departments have been inconsistent in how they track and report BIP data. As a result, neither City officials nor the business community can accurately assess the rates at which certified businesses are participating in City contracts. This makes it difficult to determine which types of businesses are being left out of contracting opportunities, and whether the City needs to engage certain businesses for additional outreach or capacity development.\n\nImprovements in these areas will give the City the tools and information it needs to make larger decisions about the future of BIP.\n\nLocal and Small Business Participation in City Contracts\n\nProposition 209 did not limit the City’s ability to implement contracting initiatives that consider race- and gender-neutral factors like business location and size. The City Charter authorizes the City to provide bid preferences to businesses located in the State of California and Los Angeles County.\n\nFortunately, the City has policies and programs in place which lay a foundation for improving its ability to connect local firms to contracting opportunities. The City currently offers limited bid preferences for certified Local Business Enterprises and Small Local Business Enterprises. However, there are opportunities to include more local small businesses in the City’s procurement enterprise.\n\nImplementation of targeted subcontracting minimums for large contracts – The City should consider requiring prime contractors to include certified local small businesses as subcontractors by establishing a minimum participation rate for each contract. This strategy would ensure that local small businesses partner with larger firms and participate in contracts which they would not normally be able to compete for as a prime. This could create new opportunities for local small businesses – many of which are owned by women, people of color, disabled veterans, and other groups.\n\nThe City’s proprietary departments – Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), Port of Los Angeles (POLA), and Department of Water and Power (LADWP) – have taken this approach. The proprietary departments develop individually tailored mandatory small business participation rates for each contract. As a result, proprietary departments have increased the number of small businesses participating in their contracts.\n\nAn important factor in the implementation of these programs is that each proprietary department has a full-time procurement staff consisting of professionals with specific industry knowledge to set local and small business participation requirements on a contract-by-contract basis. Scaling up this approach to Council-controlled departments will require decisions about which departments have the necessary procurement expertise to successfully implement the initiative.\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles, which was the first department to implement such a strategy, has seen the greatest increase in small business participation. In 2006, the year prior to the implementation of mandatory small business minimums, the Port’s small business participation rate was just 4 percent. Since implementing the program, participation by small businesses has increased considerably – an average of 37 percent of the Port’s contracting dollars went to small businesses during the last three fiscal years. Both the Department of Water and Power and Los Angeles World Airports have seen similar trends with their programs.\n\nAlthough these trends represent a limited sample size and further in-depth analysis is required before larger conclusions can be drawn, they are a promising indicator of what might be possible if the Council-controlled departments emulated the proprietary departments’ approach. In implementing mandatory small business subcontracting minimums, the City should carefully monitor participation by firms owned by women and people of color to ensure the program does not negatively impact participation by those groups.\n\nMandatory small business inclusion would provide vitally important opportunities to small businesses. In FY 2019, City departments spent approximately $2.2 billion on contracting (excluding proprietary departments). If the City for example had achieved a 25 percent small business participation rate, it would have resulted in an estimated $550 million in contracting commitments to small businesses. A 15 percent participation rate would have resulted in $330 million for small businesses.\n\nUsing mentorship programs to help small businesses gain experience and grow – The City should also seek to develop mentorship programs that help small businesses grow, and eventually develop sufficient capacity to compete as prime contractors. Specifically, the City could consider the development of a mentor-protégé program. This type of program would require prime contractors competing for large City contracts to develop a plan specifically outlining how they will mentor and provide technical training and support to one or more small businesses.\n\nThe goal of mentorship programs is to help small businesses gain skills in areas where they may lack expertise, such as accounting or marketing. In addition, prime contractors that have previously done business with the City can help smaller firms navigate the complex contracting processes of the City and other government agencies. Effective mentorship by prime contractors would be an important step in helping small and emerging firms become more competitive.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nNow is the time for the City to improve its contracting approach so it can help the local economy recover and grow. The recommendations in this report are intended to provide City Policymakers and the Chief Procurement Officer with the tools they need to make decisions about the future of BIP, and build on existing efforts to use the City’s contracting dollars to support as many local small businesses as possible.\n\nRecommendation #1\n\nImplement program changes through executive or legislative action that provides departments with clear guidance about program goals, roles and responsibilities, processes, and reporting requirements. At minimum, these reforms should:\n\nidentify or establish a City department or working group and provide them with the resources and authority necessary to effectively monitor and enforce BIP requirements;\nredesign the prime contractor outreach process to promote streamlined and meaningful outreach to certified firms, including small businesses, local businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color; and\nestablish controls ensuring the standardization of BIP data collection and reporting by City departments and regularly publish or make that data available via a public dashboard.\n\nRecommendation #2\n\nConsider expanding the BIP program to include new benefits for small businesses seeking to grow and conduct business with the City. Specifically, the City should establish pilot programs to:\n\nrequire mandatory local small business participation for larger City contracts when subcontracting opportunities are identified; and\ncreate a mentor-protégé program where more experienced prime contractors are required or incentivized to provide technical training and guidance to smaller firms.\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City spends billions of dollars each year on goods and services from the private sector to support a wide range of government operations. Given this substantial purchasing power, it is in the City’s best interest to leverage its contract spending to support the local economy and hardworking Angelenos. Investing in local businesses has taken on new importance in light of the emerging economic downturn, which will have a lasting impact on many local businesses.\n\nUnfortunately, the disruption caused by COVID-19 has devastated businesses and laid bare many of the existing inequities in communities across Los Angeles. Small businesses and businesses owned by women and people of color are especially vulnerable because they already face institutional barriers and it can be difficult to access capital from banks and other sources.\n\nFinding ways to connect vulnerable businesses to loans and other forms of assistance is critical, but it is also important to identify longer-term solutions to help businesses recover and grow. At the local level, the City has programs and policies in place that are intended to:\n\nconnect entrepreneurs with business development resources and technical assistance;\ncreate incentives that make it easier for businesses located in Los Angeles and surrounding areas to do business with the City; and\nincrease outreach to businesses owned by women, people of color, disabled veterans, and other groups so that they are aware of City contracting opportunities.\n\nGiven the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical that the City maximize the impact of its purchasing power and contracting tools. We evaluated the City’s current approach and identified practical strategies that can improve the City’s ability to circulate contracting dollars throughout the local economy and help Los Angeles businesses and residents get back to work.\n\nThe City’s Procurement Framework\n\nUnlike other large local governments, such as Los Angeles County, the City and County of San Francisco, the City of Los Angeles has a highly decentralized procurement structure. Varying levels of procurement authority and functions are delegated across City departments, and many of the processes associated with the contracting lifecycle are not automated.\n\nThe City has taken steps to reform many aspects of its overall procurement enterprise. The City hired its first Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) in 2018 and is focusing on streamlining City procurement processes for all businesses. In addition, the Department of General Services (GSD), which manages commodities purchases, has implemented a new procurement system so it can better manage the procurement lifecycle for goods, materials, and equipment. But the overall decentralized procurement model remains, which impedes development of a business-friendly contracting environment and standardized program management.\n\nCity departments procure many types of goods and services, ranging from heavy equipment for the Bureau of Street Services, to specialized information technology consulting to help modernize the City’s information systems. City contracts with private businesses typically fall into one of three categories – construction, personal (i.e., professional) services, and commodities.\n\nConstruction\n\n \n\n\tContracts covering the construction and retrofits of City infrastructure and facilities\nPersonal (i.e., Professional) Services\tContracts for services, such as legal support, medical services, specialized consulting, and janitorial services, among others\nCommodities\tContracts covering the procurement of goods such as supplies, materials, equipment, and vehicles\n\n \n\nWhen a City department identifies a contracting need, it develops a solicitation that includes information such as minimum product specifications, minimum vendor qualifications, and the scope of services needed. Most City contracts go through an open and competitive bidding process. All City departments advertise opportunities via the Los Angeles Business Assistance Virtual Network (LABAVN), which is the City’s central, online portal for managing bid solicitations.\n\nBusiness Assistance Programs Offered by the City\n\nThe City offers several programs aimed at helping businesses. Some of these programs are intended to help companies do business with the City as a contractor, while others are designed to help entrepreneurs navigate the hurdles and complexities of starting and running a business.\n\nCOVID-19 Small Business Emergency Loan Program\n\n(Economic and Workforce Development Dept.)\n\n\tDuring the COVID-19 crisis, the City has administered microloans to eligible small businesses within the City which serve as a lifeline as those businesses cope with unexpected financial stress and lost revenue.\nBusinessSource Centers\n\n(Economic and Workforce Development Dept.)\n\n\tTen of these resource centers are located throughout the City offering free or affordable business services, including business development consulting, financing solutions, training, and tax consulting.\nSmall Business Loan Program\n\n(Economic and Workforce Development Dept.)\n\n\tThis program offers loans to small businesses that might otherwise be unable to obtain loans from private lenders. Of the jobs created by the loan recipient, 51 percent must be made available to low and moderate-income individuals.\nRestaurant and Small Business Express Program\n\n(Dept. of Building and Safety)\n\n\tThis program helps businesses open on time and on budget. Participating businesses are assigned case managers to facilitate the permitting, construction, and inspection process, which includes multiple departments.\nContractor Development and Bonding Program\n\n(City Administrative Officer)\n\n\tThis program helps small businesses compete for City contracting dollars. Participants receive a case manager to consult on capacity and business development needs and are also eligible for bond (insurance) assistance.\nSmall Business Academy\n\n(Dept. of Public Works, LAWA, LADWP, POLA)\n\n\tThis seven-session academy teaches small businesses about marketing, financing, insurance, and other business development topics. Participants also learn about the City contracting process and how to compete for contracts.\n\n \n\nAs the economy grapples with a pandemic-induced recession, the City’s efforts to help vulnerable businesses have taken on a new level of urgency. For years, the City has administered a range of programs to provide contracting opportunities to local and small businesses and businesses owned by women and people of color. The overall design – and limitations – of these efforts are shaped by the City’s decentralized procurement framework and legal requirements set forth in the California State Constitution and City Charter.\n\nTHE CITY’S BUSINESS INCLUSION PROGRAM\n\nWhile the federal government and some state and local government agencies outside of California can develop race- and gender-conscious contracting programs to help women and people of color participate in government contracting, the City of Los Angeles is currently unable to develop programs using a similar approach. Proposition 209 (1996) amended the California Constitution and prohibited public agencies in California from using gender and race as a factor in contract awards.\n\nHowever, there may be opportunities to implement race- and gender-conscious procurement programs in the future. State legislators recently voted to place a ballot measure (ACA 5) before voters in November 2020 which – if approved – would repeal Proposition 209. Revisions to the City Charter to allow race and gender as a factor in contracting would also be needed, which requires citywide voter approval. In addition, the City would need to demonstrate contracting disparities before developing a narrowly tailored program to remedy those issues.\n\nIn anticipation of the potential repeal of Proposition 209, the Mayor issued Executive Directive 27, which requires departments to develop Racial Equity Plans, and initiates a citywide review of hiring and contracting data to identify racial disparities. The City Council has also introduced motions directing departments to explore ways to support the inclusion of disadvantaged businesses in City contracting. While these are positive first steps, the City needs to address fundamental weaknesses in its business inclusion strategy.\n\nBIP was established in 2011 through Executive Directive 14 (ED14).[1] BIP is a broad effort which aims to increase contracting transparency and make it easier for local businesses, small businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color to participate in City contracting.[2] The primary goal of ED14 was to establish a single web portal that would allow any business to search for City contracting opportunities. The web portal would also serve as a platform allowing businesses to communicate with one another to make it easier for firms to develop subcontracting partnerships.\n\nED 14 represented a significant change to how departments advertised their contracting opportunities by mandating the following:\n\nall departments must use the City’s Los Angles Businesses Virtual Network (LABAVN) to advertise contracts, creating a one-stop solution for advertisements;\nfirms competing for contracts must reach out to a minimum number of small business, local businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color to discuss potential subcontracting opportunities; and\nfirms competing for contracts must reach out to potential subcontractors using LABAVN’s messaging portal, which automatically documents their outreach efforts.\n\nThe outreach requirement – commonly referred to as “good faith effort” or GFE – is intended to ensure prime contractors take reasonable steps to develop subcontracting partnerships with businesses that typically face institutional barriers and higher operating costs in comparison to other regions in the United States. The intended targets for GFE outreach are firms registered in LABAVN with specific business certifications.\n\nEligible businesses can become certified with one of several designations. The certifications recognized by the City have been established through a series of City Council actions, Mayoral Executive Directives, and federal laws intended to help level the playing field for all businesses. As shown in the table below, most of these certifications are race- and gender-neutral, and have certification criteria based on business size, revenue, and location.  \n\nCertification\tGeneral Business Requirements\tRace/Gender Neutral?\nMinority Business Enterprise (MBE)\tAt least 51% owned and controlled by minority individuals\tNo\nWomen Business Enterprise (WBE)\tAt least 51% owned and controlled by women\tNo\nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)\tAt least 51% owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged minority individuals[3]\tNo\nLesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Business Enterprise (LGBTBE)\tAt least 51% owned and controlled by lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender persons\tNo\nSmall Business Enterprise (SBE)\tA principal office in CA, and 3 years gross receipts averaging less than $15 million for construction firms, or less than $7 million for non-construction firms\tYes\nEmerging Business Enterprise (EBE)\tA principal office in CA, and 3 years gross receipts averaging less than $5 million\tYes\nDisabled Veteran Business Enterprise (DVBE)\tAt least 51% owned and controlled by disabled veterans living in CA and headquartered in CA\tYes\nLocal Business Enterprise (LBE)\tAt least 50 full time employees headquartered, or spending at least 60% of their total hours within LA County[4]\tYes\nSmall Local Business (SLB)\tA principal office within LA County, and 3 years gross receipts averaging less than $3 million\tYes\nSmall Business Enterprise – Proprietary Departments (SBE-P)\tBased on U.S. Small Business Administration criteria for each NAICS classification or 3 years gross receipts averaging less than $15 million (whichever is greater)[5]\tYes\nVery Small Business Enterprise – POLA (VSBE)\tA principal office in CA and 3 years gross receipts averaging less than $5 million or a small business manufacturer with 25 or fewer employees\tYes\n\n \n\nThere are approximately 6,000 certified businesses listed in LABAVN, and an individual business can possess multiple certifications. For example, a woman-owned law firm located in Los Angeles with gross receipts of less than $7 million may be certified as WBE, DBE, SBE, LBE, and SBE-P. Within the City, the Public Works Bureau of Contract Administration (BCA) is responsible for reviewing applications and issuing certifications. The City also recognizes certain certifications issued by federal, state, and local agencies.\n\nCertifications play a central role in helping firms learn about subcontracting opportunities. The process by which certified businesses receive notifications about subcontracting opportunities is described below.\n\nContracting managers are tasked with determining whether the contractors met the outreach steps described above, in addition to other activities. To be deemed responsive, prime contractors must demonstrate that they have successfully completed the following:\n\nattend pre-bid/proposal meeting(s);\nidentify sufficient work for subcontracting;\nsend written notices to potential subcontractors notifying them of the opportunity;\nprovide information to potential subcontractors about the availability of relevant plans/specifications;\nnegotiate in good faith with subcontractors that submit bids/proposals; and\noffer assistance to subcontractors in obtaining bonds, lines of credit, and insurance required by the City or prime contractor.\n\nFailure to comply with these requirements will render a bid or proposal nonresponsive and result in its rejection but the City cannot compel prime contractors to partner with firms owned by women and people of color because of Proposition 209.\n\nAlthough the City can enforce its outreach requirement by rejecting bids or proposals from contractors that fail to comply, measuring the impact of outreach conducted through BIP would help policymakers improve the program. The City must consider whether facilitating communication between the prime contractor and certified businesses is enough to expand the number of firms participating in City contracts and create a sustainable boost to the local economy.\n\nThe City is Unable to Accurately Measure the Impact of BIP\n\nDuring this review, we identified several issues related to the BIP outreach process and the City’s implementation of the program that need to be addressed moving forward. While some of the program management concerns we identified are largely the result of the City’s decentralized procurement framework, other issues indicate that larger changes may be needed to help BIP achieve its intended outcomes.\n\nInclusion through outreach – Because the City does not compel prime contractors to partner with certified businesses, the outreach process is regarded by some contracting managers as superficial – and most likely ineffective. Ultimately, prime contractors who see contracting equity as an added value will find ways to partner with certified businesses, while prime contractors who see subcontracting dollars paid to certified businesses as foregone profits will not.\n\nAll programs require ongoing evaluation and refinement to ensure that they are achieving their intended outcomes. Moving forward, the City should weigh its options as it relates to the long-term direction of BIP. This process requires the ability to discern the extent to which program design and implementation factors have contributed to its shortcomings. Unfortunately, the City’s ability to make informed decisions about BIP is impeded by longstanding citywide procurement challenges.\n\nLack of a dedicated program manager – Each City department’s procurement needs are different. Large departments such as BCA have experienced procurement staff whose primary task is to oversee the contract lifecycles of multimillion-dollar contracts. Smaller departments that manage contracts less frequently may assign contracting manager responsibilities on an ad hoc basis.\n\nThe City’s decentralized procurement model impacts citywide efforts to consistently administer BIP, and the procurement process in general. Prior to the appointment of the CPO, BCA (which manages public works contracts) served as a de facto contracting and BIP advisor to City departments. However, BCA was not responsible for managing BIP and did not have authority to instruct other City departments to make improvements.\n\nThe CPO, who now serves as the BIP program business owner, plans to modernize BIP outreach with the eventual replacement of LABAVN. The new application is intended to operate as a virtual marketplace that will improve the ability of firms to match with one another and develop new business relationships. However, BIP improvements is one of several procurement reform initiatives under the CPO’s purview. Furthermore, with a relatively small team of just three analysts, the CPO likely lacks sufficient resources to monitor departments’ compliance with BIP outreach and data reporting requirements on an ongoing basis.\n\nMany of the City’s peers, including Los Angeles County, the City and County of San Francisco, and the City of San Diego, have citywide procurement management departments that are responsible for either centrally managing purchasing and contracting, or acting as a procurement support unit to other departments. These departments are typically responsible for managing similar contracting equity programs. Without such a department in the City of Los Angeles, consistent implementation and monitoring of BIP will remain difficult.\n\nInadequate data collection and reporting – ED14 requires departments to report BIP participation rates on a quarterly basis to the Office of the Mayor and a Small and Disabled Veteran Business Procurement Advisory Committee. However, this advisory committee is now defunct, and the City does not regularly report citywide business inclusion data.\n\nEven if there was centralized leadership in place to oversee the program, accurate and timely data collection would be nearly impossible. The City does not have a centralized procurement management system and departments have been inconsistent in how they track and report BIP data.\n\nAs a result, neither City officials nor the business community can adequately assess the rates at which certified businesses are participating in City contracts. This makes it difficult to determine which types of businesses are being left out of contracting opportunities, and whether the City needs to target certain businesses for additional outreach or capacity development.\n\nThe most recent effort by the City to develop a comprehensive BIP progress report was in response to a request by the City Council in 2016. BCA was tasked with compiling data from other departments because the City lacked a centralized procurement system and dedicated BIP manager. Although BCA generated the report, the reliability of the self-reported data is low, and some departments did not provide any information.\n\nWhile the City can take steps to create an environment where certified firms are more aware of business opportunities, a fundamental weakness of BIP is its reliance on prime contractors working in good faith to develop subcontracts. Improvements to program governance and data collection will give the City the tools and information it needs to make larger decisions about the future of BIP.\n\n[1] The City’s first women and minority business enterprise initiative for City contracting was established in a 1983 Executive Directive.\n\n[2] Though formally exempt from the program, the directive requested that the City’s proprietary departments – Los Angeles World Airports, Port of Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power – implement similar programs and policies.\n\n[3] Federal DBE guidelines recognize women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian-Pacific Americans as socially and economically disadvantaged. Other individuals can also qualify as socially and economically disadvantaged on a case-by-case basis.\n\n[4] POLA has a separate Local Business Enterprise certification which includes businesses headquartered within Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura Counties.\n\n[5] The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is the classification standard used by federal agencies for classifying business establishments. The system facilitates the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the U.S. economy.\n\nLOCAL AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION IN CITY CONTRACTS\n\nWhile Proposition 209 strictly prohibits the City from providing any kind of contracting preference to firms based on race or gender, it does not restrict cities from implementing race- and gender-neutral contracting initiatives that consider factors like business location, size, and revenue.\n\nThe Board of Public Works is testing what is known as “community-based contracting”, where large public works projects are broken into a series of smaller contracts so that small, locally-based firms have the ability to compete for the opportunities. While this and other initiatives are a good start, the City can do much more to promote the inclusion of local small businesses in City contracts.\n\nFortunately, the City already has a framework in place that can help the City expand existing efforts to help local and small businesses. New small business initiatives could create fresh opportunities for local small businesses, many of which are owned by women, people of color, disabled veterans, and other groups.\n\nThe City Charter generally requires departments to award contracts to the lowest responsible bidder, but it does allow the City to provide preference to firms based in the State of California and Los Angeles County. Excluding certifications used exclusively by proprietary departments, the City has three small business certifications restricted to firms located in California or Los Angeles County. Those certifications include:\n\nSmall Business Enterprise;\nEmerging Businesses Enterprise; and\nSmall Local Business Enterprise.\n\nThe City currently offers bid preference for two certification types – Local Business Enterprises and Small Local Business Enterprises.[6] The City Council established both programs recognizing that firms operating in the Los Angeles area face higher labor and operating costs compared to neighboring states and other counties within California. In addition to receiving additional outreach through BIP, the City’s procurement process affords firms certified under these programs with an advantage when they are competing for City contracts.\n\nLocal Business Preference\tFor contracts that are $150,000 or greater, Local Business Enterprises (LBE) shall receive preference in the form of an eight percent reduction in the bid price or an eight percent increase in the proposer’s score. Non-LBE firms can receive preference points of up to five percent, based on amount of work to be performed by LBE subcontractors.[7]\nSmall, Local Business Preference\tFor contracts that are $100,000 or less, SLB bidders and proposers shall receive a preference in the form of a ten percent reduction in the bid or proposal price.\n\n \n\nWhile these programs are a good initial step in encouraging the investment of contracting dollars within the local economy, the City should consider expanding local preference programs to ensure small businesses are participating in City contracts.\n\nImplementation of Targeted Subcontracting Minimums for Large Contracts\n\nThe City should consider requiring prime contractors to include local small businesses as subcontractors by establishing a minimum participation rate for each contract. This strategy would ensure that local small businesses partner with larger firms and participate in contracts which they would not normally be able to compete for. For each contract, departments would set minimum small business participation levels based on multiple factors, including:\n\nthe type of contract and the pool of available small businesses based on NAICS data;\nthe number of certified firms available to perform the work in LABAVN; and\nsmall business participation rates for similar projects in the past.\n\nFor example, if a department is seeking bids for the construction of a new building at an estimated cost of $1 million, the department could require prime contractors competing for the project to meet a small business participation rate of 20 percent of the contract value. If the prime contractor’s bid shows that 20 percent of the work will be performed by a small, locally owned construction firm, the prime contractor will have met the participation requirement. If the prime contractor wins the contract, the small business would perform $200,000 (20 percent) worth of services for the prime contractor. In the event a prime contractor fails to meet small business subcontracting commitments, the firm could be subject to financial penalty.\n\nThis strategy has already proved successful at the City’s three proprietary departments (POLA, LAWA, and LADWP). Each department’s respective Board of Commissioners established a mandatory small business participation program to increase support for small businesses and increase the number of firms conducting business with the department.\n\nEach proprietary department sets mandatory small business participation minimums for construction and personal services contracts. POLA, which was the first to establish their small business program, has seen the greatest increase in participation levels as a percentage of total contract awards. POLA’s small business participation rate averaged 37 percent from FY2017 through FY2019. Both LADWP and LAWA have seen similar trends with their programs.\n\nAlthough these trends represent a limited sample size and further in-depth analysis is required before conclusions can be drawn, they are a promising indicator of what might be possible if the Council-controlled departments emulated the proprietary departments’ approach. It is important to note that the small business size threshold (based on annual gross receipts) for proprietary departments is larger than the threshold for the City’s Small Business Enterprise certification.[8]\n\nMandatory small business inclusion could provide important opportunities to local and small businesses. In FY2019, City departments spent about $2.2 billion on contracting (excluding LAWA, LADWP, and POLA). If the City for example had achieved a 25 percent small business participation rate, it would have resulted in an estimated $550 million in contracting commitments to small businesses. A 15 percent participation rate would have resulted in $330 million for small businesses.\n\nAn important issue to consider is that each proprietary department has a full-time procurement staff consisting of professionals with specific industry knowledge to set local and small business participation requirements on a contract-by-contract basis. Scaling up this approach to Council-controlled departments will require decisions about which departments have the necessary procurement expertise to successfully implement the initiative.\n\nIn implementing mandatory small business subcontracting minimums, the City would also need to carefully monitor participation by firms owned by women and people of color to ensure the program does not negatively impact participation by those groups. The City would also need to ensure that departments develop reasonable small businesses participation requirements, and all departments are consistent in how they develop participation rates. Alternatively, it may also be beneficial for a single office to be responsible for establishment of participation rates for all City contracts to ensure the criteria is applied consistently citywide.\n\nUsing Mentorship Programs to Help Small Businesses Gain Experience and Grow\n\nAlthough the City already administers programs which provide direct training and development services to small and disadvantaged businesses – such as the Contractor Development and Bonding Program and the Small Business Academy – there are opportunities to leverage the expertise and resources of large City contractors in order to assist small businesses in need of developmental assistance. This assistance could come in the form of a mentor-protégé program.\n\nThe goal of a mentor-protégé program is to help small and emerging firms develop the skills and capabilities that allow them to successfully compete as prime contractors. In a mentor-protégé program, the City would require prime contractors competing for large City contracts to develop a mentorship plan specifically outlining how it will mentor and provide technical training and support to one or more small businesses.\n\nSpecifically, prime contractors would need to develop a formal plan to:\n\nprovide mentorship, training, and technical assistance in areas such as finance, insurance, organizational development and design, and human capital;\ncreate business outreach and networking opportunities; and\nincorporate protégés into future subcontracting roles.\n\nMentorship could extend to one of several certification types, including Emerging Business Enterprises, Small Business Enterprises, and Small, Local Business Enterprises. Other large public agencies have instituted mentor-protégé programs for disadvantaged or small businesses. LA Metro for example requires prime contractors competing for contracts valued at more than $25 million to submit a mentorship plan for certified Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, Small Business Enterprises, and Disabled Veteran Business Enterprises.\n\nThe City of San Francisco also manages a mentor-protégé program. Rather than requiring prime contractors to provide mentorship opportunities, both mentors and protégés apply to be members of the program. Mentors must have experience as a successful prime contractor, while firms with the City’s Micro-Local Business Enterprise certification are eligible to participate as protégés. As an incentive for prime contractors to serve as mentors, the City of San Francisco will waive prime contractors’ good faith outreach requirements for a period of two years.[9]\n\nThe City should continue to encourage large firms to mentor small businesses and entrepreneurs within the local community. Not only does mentorship and capacity development guidance help foster small business growth, it paves the way for future business relationships and better positions small firms to eventually compete as a prime contractor.\n\n[6] The City Council established the Local Business Preference Program by ordinance in 2011 and the Small, Local Business Program by ordinance in 2001.\n\n[7] The City Council has approved changes to the Local Business Preference Program (Council File 18-0255). Under the proposal, the Small, Local Business Preference Program would be merged into the Local Business Preference Program. Local Business Enterprises would receive an eight percent bid preference, and those also holding a Small Business Enterprise certification would receive an additional preference of two percent. Small, Local Business Enterprises competing for contracts valued at $150,000 or less would receive a ten percent bid preference.\n\n[8] The Small Business Enterprise-Proprietary certification is tied to specific size standards set by the U.S. Small Business Administration for each NAICS code.\n\n[9] The City of San Francisco requires firms competing as prime contractors to reach out to and negotiate in good faith with firms holding the city’s Local Business Enterprise certifications.\n\nCONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nNow is the time for the City to improve its contracting approach so it can help the local economy recover and grow. The recommendations in this report are intended to provide City Policymakers and the Chief Procurement Officer with the tools they need to make decisions about the future of BIP, and build on existing efforts to use the City’s contracting dollars to support as many local small businesses as possible.\n\nRecommendation #1\n\nImplement program changes through executive or legislative action that provides departments with clear guidance about program goals, roles and responsibilities, processes, and reporting requirements. At minimum, these reforms should:\n\nidentify or establish a City department or working group and provide them with the resources and authority necessary to effectively monitor and enforce BIP requirements;\nredesign the prime contractor outreach process to promote streamlined and meaningful outreach to certified firms, including small businesses, local businesses, and businesses owned by women and people of color; and\nestablish controls ensuring the standardization of BIP data collection and reporting by City departments and regularly publish or make that data available via a public dashboard.\n\nRecommendation #2\n\nConsider expanding the BIP program to include new benefits for small businesses seeking to grow and conduct business with the City. Specifically, the City should establish pilot programs to:\n\nrequire mandatory small business participation for larger City contracts when subcontracting opportunities are identified; and\ncreate a mentor-protégé program where more experienced prime contractors are required or incentivized to provide technical training and guidance to smaller firms."

Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\n\nJune 17, 2020\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Michael Feuer, City Attorney\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: A More Modern Approach to City-Owned Art\n\n\nThe City of Los Angeles is a global hub of art and culture. Regionally- and even world-renowned painters, photographers, sculptors, and lithographers call our City home and produce groundbreaking artwork in our midst. The art created in Los Angeles helps shape our communities into richer, more vibrant spaces: from public museums and locally owned galleries to murals on freeway walls and neighborhood art centers.\n\nThe City itself owns thousands of pieces of art, some of which were commissioned, and others donated by artists, patrons or local organizations. There are three distinct categories of City-owned art: Proprietary Department Art (owned by the Airport, Port and Department of Water and Power); Public Art; and the City Art Collection. The Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) is the designated caretaker of the latter two categories of art, including the 2,500-piece City Art Collection. The works in this collection have been approved for display on City property or were acquired by donation or gift with approval from the Cultural Affairs Commission. My latest report covers the management and maintenance of this collection and urges the City to make changes that will improve art conservation and oversight.\n\nAt present, management of the City Art Collection is rooted in the past. While DCA does important work — managing art centers, historic sites, the Percent for Public Art programs and Citywide Mural Program, among other things — persistent budget limitations and staffing have made it challenging for DCA to serve as an effective steward of the City Art Collection. My report found that DCA has suspended its ongoing monitoring and management of the City Art Collection, leaving management to a series of databases that are outdated, ineffective and decentralized. In addition, there is currently no regular inventory process for City art, no regular condition assessment to determine art conservation needs, no enforcement mechanism to ensure that works out on loan are properly displayed and stored, and no ability to release or donate art that is valueless or damaged beyond repair.\n\nInadequate oversight has led to a City Art Collection that is both shoddy and incomplete. Specifically, 18 percent of the collection is currently missing (with some reported stolen) and 41 percent lacks identifying photographs. Of the 867 artworks with collection data, 25 percent (or 221) are damaged or in poor condition. And only half the collection has appraisal information — with a total value of approximately $19 million — but most of the appraisals were done 16 to 18 years ago and more than 100 pieces were appraised more than 40 years ago.\n\nVisualizing better art management\n\nModernizing the City’s art management program will not only improve the City Art Collection, but also enhance DCA’s art oversight across all City departments. My report makes the following recommendations:\n\nDevelop a comprehensive inventory of City-owned art, including the City Art Collection, Public Art and Proprietary Department Art. Updated conservation needs and appraisal information should be part of the inventory.\nImplement a modern collection management system using updated technology to track the location, loan history and condition of all City-owned art.\nCreate an online catalog and map of City-owned art that will allow people to learn about the collection and where it is displayed, increasing transparency and accessibility of the City’s collection.\nDevelop a policy on releasing art that is damaged or too costly to maintain.\nEstablish a loan monitoring program to certify that the City’s art is accounted for and maintained while on loan.\nLeverage the know-how of local arts organizations, academic institutions, and community experts on better ways to evaluate and showcase City art.\n\nI urge City leaders to adopt these recommendations to ensure that Los Angeles takes the necessary steps to protect and preserve City-owned art. Angelenos should be able to access and enjoy the City’s cultural heritage now and in the decades to come.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe arts are an essential part of what makes Los Angeles such a vibrant city. The City’s Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) plays an important role in ensuring that Los Angeles remains a global center for art through its various community art programs and its grant programs that support local artists. DCA also operates art centers and historic sites such as the Watts Towers, Los Angeles Municipal Arts Gallery, and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Hollyhock House – which was recently recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nAs the lead department for promoting arts and culture, DCA acts as the primary steward for City-owned art. The City owns thousands of artworks that can be seen in public spaces and in City buildings throughout Los Angeles. The City’s collection of artwork is incredibly diverse, and includes paintings, photographs, sculptures, murals, and artifacts such as rare furniture. City-owned works of art are important because they support the development of creative spaces and communities, and help to ensure Angelenos can experience art in their daily lives.\n\nThe City also maintains thousands of historical artifacts that provide insights into world events and Los Angeles’ own rich history. The Los Angeles Public Library has over 22,000 volumes of rare books and materials dating back to the fifteenth century, as well as thousands of photographs, maps, and other printed materials. Other City departments, such as the Port of Los Angeles, maintain archives with photographs and artifacts which preserve the history of the departments, and shed light on their unique contributions to the development of Los Angeles.\n\nDue to its inherent cultural and historic value, the City Art Collection – which consists of approximately 2,500 works of art managed by DCA – is the primary focus of this review. However, this report also examines how DCA can better track, maintain, and care for other types of art under its care, and support the artwork management programs of the City’s proprietary departments (Los Angeles World Airports, the Port of Los Angeles, and the Department of Water and Power).\n\nWHAT WE FOUND\n\nThe City has not done enough to ensure its artworks are properly cared for. Approximately 18 percent of works in the City Art Collection are unaccounted for, some of which were reported as stolen. In addition, the lack of publicly-available information about City art makes it more difficult to access. The City Art Collection Program is effectively on hiatus, severely limiting DCA’s ability to serve as an effective steward of City-owned works of art.\n\nNo regular inventories – DCA does not conduct regular inventories of City-owned art.\nNo regular condition assessments – DCA does not regularly evaluate the condition of artworks to identify maintenance and conservation needs.\nLack of loan enforcement – The department is unable to enforce the terms of loan agreements, such as the length of time items are on loan or conditions related to the display and storage of loaned items.\nInability to downsize the collection – DCA has no formal deaccessioning policy allowing it to release or donate artworks which no longer add value, or are too heavily damaged to restore.\n\nInsufficient oversight of City artworks greatly increases the risk of art being misplaced, damaged, or stolen. Our review of DCA’s Art Collection Database identified the following issues.\n\nMissing art – City Art Collection Database records indicate that 444 artworks (18 percent of the collection) are unaccounted for.\nDamaged art – Condition data is available for only 867 works of art. DCA’s condition assessments indicate that 646 are in excellent, good, or fair condition, while 221 (25 percent) were in poor condition or had some type of damage.\nOutdated appraisals – Although it may be unnecessary to appraise each item, appraisal information currently exists for just half of the City Art Collection. The vast majority of the appraisals (1,061) occurred between 2002 and 2004, and nearly 100 appraisals occurred prior to 1980.\nLack of identifying photographs – The City Art Collection database lacks an identifying photograph for 1,030 (41 percent) Photographs of collection items not only help to facilitate inventories by helping staffers to identify works of art, but are vital in helping law enforcement officers investigate and recover stolen pieces.\n\nDCA has also struggled to keep information in the City Art Collection database current, and information about other types of art – such as public art and proprietary department art – is spread out across multiple databases and spreadsheets, some of which are maintained by proprietary departments.\n\nWhile other public agencies have shifted toward using modern art collection management systems with integrated inventory tracking and maintenance management features, DCA has relied on Microsoft Access databases which are not designed for collection management. DCA’s reliance on older systems makes management of both artwork data – and the artworks themselves – more difficult.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe City must take steps to fully account for what it owns, care for those works of art on an ongoing basis, and make the art more accessible to the public. Maintaining City artworks, and ensuring the public can easily learn about and visit collection items, will help connect Angelenos to art and the City’s history.\n\nAs City policymakers make funding decisions related to arts programs, it is important to recognize the need to re-establish and modernize the City’s artwork management program. This report makes several recommendations aimed at reviving the City Art Collection program, and improving the way DCA manages art across all City departments.\n\nTo improve its management of City-owned art, DCA should:\n\nDevelop an updated, comprehensive inventory of City-owned art which includes the City Art Collection, public art, and artworks belonging to proprietary departments. In developing an updated inventory, the department should evaluate the condition and conservation needs of artworks, and update appraisal information.\nImplement a new collection management system to improve DCA’s ability to track artworks’ location, loan history, and condition. The technology should also include the ability to integrate digital images, as well as track maintenance lifecycles, and artwork loan lifecycles.\nMake artworks more accessible by developing an online catalog and map of City-owned artworks which enables the public to learn about artworks and artifacts, and where those items are on display.\nDevelop a formal deaccessioning policy that allows art managers to identify and release art which no longer adds value, or has become too costly to maintain. When deaccessioning items, DCA should consider whether the artworks or artifacts should be donated to an organization that will serve as a responsible conservator and steward.\nEstablish an inventory monitoring program which certifies on an ongoing basis that the City’s artworks, especially those on loan to City departments and external organizations, are accounted for and maintained in accordance with loan agreements.\nLeverage the subject matter expertise of local arts organizations, academic institutions, and other experts within the community as it works to inventory, evaluate, and showcase City works of art.\n\nFrom murals to museums, art helps Angelenos connect with culture and history, and fosters an environment of creativity and imagination. Protecting and preserving the City’s art – as well as making information about art as accessible as possible – will help to ensure that Angelenos can connect to the City’s cultural heritage for years to come.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe arts play a key role in helping Los Angeles thrive by creating a sense of community, highlighting the value of cultural diversity, and supporting the region’s ever important creative economy. According to a recent study by the Otis College of Art and Design, creative industries employ an estimated 415,000 workers in Los Angeles County, making it the largest center for creative professions in the United States.\n\nPublicly-owned works of art and art in the public realm are especially important because they activate neighborhoods and engage residents outside of formal settings like museums or galleries. Given these benefits, it is essential that the City do its part to support the development of arts programs and creative spaces.\n\nOne of the lesser known components of the City’s overall arts program is its expansive art collection, which consists of paintings, photographs, sculptures, historical artifacts, and other items. Many of these items are unique and reflect our cultural heritage. This report examines how the City manages its art, and makes recommendations on how the City can improve its stewardship practices.\n\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF CULTURAL AFFAIRS\n\nThe Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) is the City’s lead department for promoting arts and culture in Los Angeles. DCA works in conjunction with the Cultural Affairs Commission, an advisory board appointed by the Mayor, which is responsible for reviewing and approving all architecture and artwork on City property. The Commission may also approve or disapprove of the provision of arts and culture services, as well as the construction of arts and culture facilities.\n\nWith an FY 2019-20 budget allocation of approximately $17.8 million, DCA has one of the smallest operating budgets of any City department. It is also the only department that does not receive any of the City’s $5.3 billion in unrestricted revenue.[1] Instead, DCA is funded through the Arts and Cultural Facilities and Services Trust Fund. The Arts and Cultural Facilities and Services and Services Trust Fund receives one percent of Transient Occupancy Tax revenue (i.e., hotel and vacation rental taxes), and a portion of Public Works Improvements Arts Program funds.\n\nDespite being one of the City’s smaller departments, DCA enriches the lives of many Angelenos. The department manages various community arts programs and 35 arts facilities, including community art centers, theaters, historic sites, and art galleries. The department also administers hundreds of grants each year to individual artists and nonprofit organizations. DCA estimates the department’s arts and culture centers serve approximately 500,000 people each year.\n\nWithin DCA, the Public Art Division is responsible for the creation and maintenance of various types of art in the public realm. As part of this role, the division acts as the steward of art owned by the City, and is responsible for loaning, tracking, storing, and preserving art and artifacts. However, most of the Public Art Division’s resources are dedicated to management of the City’s Percent for Public Art programs, which includes the Public Works Improvements Arts Program and the Private Arts Development Fee Program.\n\nThe Public Works Improvements Arts Program mandates that one percent of the total cost of all construction, improvement, or renovation projects undertaken by the City is set aside for public art projects. Departments often work with DCA to commission works of art at the site of the project.\nThe Private Arts Development Fee Program requires owners of private development projects valued at $500,000 or more to pay an arts fee, which DCA then administers to support art programs that provide benefits to the local community. Known as developer-led projects, a developer may also administer its own art project to fulfill the program’s requirements. Developer-led art projects are subject to DCA approvals.\n\nThe Public Art Division’s artwork stewardship and Percent for Public Art programs highlight the important role it plays in ensuring that art is a part of Angelenos’ daily lives. The division estimates it will complete more than 200 public art projects and events in FY2019-20, including permanent public art installations, temporary art exhibitions, and arts and food festivals.\n\nCITY-OWNED ART\n\nThere are several ways in which the City becomes the owner of artwork. For example, some art is commissioned by the City, while other works of art are donated by artists, arts patrons, or local organizations. City art typically falls into one of three categories.\n\nCity Art Collection\tThe City Art Collection consists of works of art that have been approved for siting on City property or acquired through donation, gift, or loan. Donations and gifts go through a formal application process that is intended to accept works that achieve artistic excellence, and represent the City in a meaningful manner. The Cultural Affairs Commission approves these donations and gifts.\nPublic Art\tPublic art consists of City art in the public realm, such as sculptures, murals, and other installations. Its public display means it is among the most accessible forms of art, promoting creative environments across the City. The City typically commissions public art as part of Percent for Public Arts programs.\nProprietary Department Art\tThe City’s proprietary departments – Los Angeles World Airports, Port of Los Angeles, and Department of Water and Power – are each under the control of their respective Boards of Commissioners. Proprietary departments own works of art, and participate in the City’s Public Works Improvements Arts Program.     \n\nThe amount of art under the City’s care is constantly changing. For example, the City recently took control of art managed by the Community Redevelopment Agency/Los Angeles (CRA/LA). CRA/LA, the successor agency to the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles, transferred 19 public art installations that were commissioned as part of the redevelopment agency’s public art program.[2]\n\nBeyond caring for City-owned art, DCA manages the Citywide Mural Program, which is working to register, preserve, and restore Los Angeles’ large network of murals. Although many of these murals are displayed on private buildings and are not owned by the City, DCA sponsors the development of new murals to re-engage communities and create opportunities for artists.\n\nIt is important to note the City also owns tens of thousands of culturally and historically significant items – many of which could be considered art – that tell stories about our local history and global events. For example, the Los Angeles Public Library has over 22,000 volumes of rare books and materials dating back to the fifteenth century, as well as thousands of photographs, maps, and other printed materials. The Port of Los Angeles also maintains an archive preserving documents, photographs, maps, and artifacts documenting the development and history of the port.\n\nWhile all of these assets are important, stewardship of the City’s Art Collection is the primary focus of this review. The City Art Collection consists of approximately 2,500 works of art and artifacts that represent the cultural fabric of Los Angeles. Many items in the City Art Collection are moveable objects, like paintings and smaller sculptures. Specifically, the collection includes watercolor paintings, oil paintings, photographs, bronze sculptures, lithographs, silkscreen prints, unique furniture and textiles, and many other forms of art. The following images highlight some of these unique pieces.\n\nDCA’s Public Art Division makes a portion of this collection available to City officials and employees through an interdepartmental loan program. These items can be found in City art centers and government buildings throughout Los Angeles. Some of this art is displayed in work spaces, while other artworks are in common areas for viewing by the public. In addition, a limited number of items are available for loan to non-City entities.\n\nCity art is an important asset that requires effective oversight. The City of Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) vests DCA with the custody and supervision of all paintings, documents, and records in possession of the City of historic or artistic value, and entrusts the department with preserving art and artifacts in a matter which prevents deterioration.\n\nDCA’s efforts to safeguard and preserve the City’s art is directly tied to its ability to track its whereabouts and condition. Beyond the overall responsibility outlined above, the LAAC requires DCA – when funding is available – to conduct an annual inspection and inventory of all paintings, murals, inscriptions, and other sculptures which are under the care and control of the City. In addition, DCA is required to establish and maintain a complete and accurate inventory of City art assets.\n\nThe size and diversity of the City’s collection presents unique challenges. Unlike some other assets owned by the City, artworks and historical artifacts cannot simply be replaced when they become old and worn down. Artwork requires consistent, ongoing monitoring to ensure effective maintenance and conservation, and it is critically important that DCA work with all departments to guarantee that the City’s art is preserved well into the future.\n\nThe following section details the current condition of the City’s Art Collection. Later in this report, we discuss how improvements in these areas should be paired with a larger effort to better safeguard and showcase all types of City-owned art.\n\n[1] DCA’s proposed budget for FY 2020-21 is $16.3 million.\n\n[2] The Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles was one of many redevelopment agencies across the state which supported housing, commercial, neighborhood, and economic development in economically underserved areas. In 2011, the California State Legislature enacted legislation which dissolved the state’s redevelopment agencies. CRA/LA was named as the successor agency tasked with winding down redevelopment agency operations.\n\nIMPROVING STEWARDSHIP OF THE CITY ART COLLECTION\n\nWith approximately 2,500 artworks and historically significant artifacts, the City Art Collection is a central component of DCA’s art portfolio. Managing the City Art Collection is inherently difficult because many of the artworks are portable, on loan to other departments and external organizations, and susceptible to theft or damage.\n\nDCA’s Public Art Division has temporarily suspended its ongoing monitoring and management of the City Art Collection, citing budgetary and staffing constraints. The Public Art Division has not had any staff dedicated to managing the collection since 2018. Even prior to 2018, there was only one part-time employee managing the collection on an as-needed basis. As a result, several artwork stewardship gaps have emerged.\n\nWEAK INVENTORY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES PUT ART AT RISK\n\nA lack of dedicated staffing, as well as insufficient program controls and collection monitoring, has placed City-owned art at risk for theft and deterioration. Currently, the Public Art Division does not:\n\nConduct regular inventories of City-owned art;\nMonitor the status of artworks that are out on loan;\nRegularly evaluate the condition of artwork; or\nEnforce the terms of loan agreements, such as the length of time items are on loan or conditions related to the display and storage of loaned items.\n\nInsufficient oversight of artworks greatly increases the risk of items being misplaced, damaged, or stolen. Regular inventories which evaluate the condition of art are needed to ensure the City’s collection is accounted for and well cared for.\n\nHUNDREDS OF ARTWORKS ARE UNACCOUNTED FOR\n\nThe lack of dedicated staffing resources, as well as inadequate safeguards for protecting City art assets, has led to a large portion of the City’s art to become unaccounted for – City Art Collection Database records indicate that 444 artworks (18 percent of the collection) are missing.[3] DCA managers believe it is likely that City employees in possession of loaned artworks have taken items home with them upon retirement or separation from City employment. They also believe that some of the missing works are in storage closets or other hidden areas within City buildings.\n\nThe City has also been the victim of theft on several occasions. Of the more than 444 works classified as missing, 185 were reported stolen to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). The circumstances under which art has been stolen varies. For example, DCA staff reported that bronze sculptures have been stolen in the past, presumably for the value of the metal materials. One such sculpture was even recovered by the LAPD at a scrap yard.\n\nIt is also likely that thieves have targeted City artworks due to their potential value. In 2000, a 1946 painting by Arthur Beaumont titled U.S.S. Cruiser Los Angeles was cut out of its frame and stolen while on display in City Hall. Beaumont is a well-known painter recognized for his portrayals of U.S. Navy accomplishments. The artwork, which is still listed in the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Stolen Art File database, has never been recovered.\n\nTHE VALUE OF THE CITY’S ARTWORKS IS NOT FULLY KNOWN\n\nAppraisal data in the City Art Collection database shows that 1,293 items – approximately half of the collection – have some form of appraisal information. The total appraised value for those items is listed as approximately $19 million. However, most of the appraisals are dated, and do not reflect the true value of the artworks. Public artworks commissioned through Percent for Public Arts programs have never been formally appraised, though the Public Art Division maintains records on the value of the contract with the artist at the time the art was commissioned.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the appraisals occurred between 2002 and 2004, and nearly 100 items were last appraised before 1980. Insufficient or outdated appraisal information can impact the ability of the Public Art Division and partner departments across the City to make informed collection management decisions. For example, outdated or incomplete appraisal information can make it difficult to determine:\n\nWhether certain artworks require special safeguards, or whether the division should refrain from loaning certain items;\nThe value of City artworks which have been lost or stolen; and\nWhether the City carries a sufficient level of insurance coverage for City-owned art, which is a critical aspect of ensuring the art is protected.[4]\n\nIt is important to note that many items in the collection – though they may provide value to the community or reflect the City’s heritage in some way – have little to no financial value. As such, appraisal information for all artworks and artifacts in the collection is likely unnecessary. Regardless, the department should have a formal and strategic methodology for determining which artworks should be appraised periodically, and how often those assessments should take place. \n\nMANY ARTWORKS ARE IN NEED OF MAINTENANCE OR RESTORATION\n\nDCA’s Public Art Division has been unable to conduct regular assessments of artworks’ condition. Regular assessments of City art assets would allow the division to: (1) improve its understanding of the condition of artworks; (2) evaluate whether restoration efforts for particular artworks are necessary; and (3) estimate the potential costs associated with completing restoration projects. Restoration efforts would also highlight the need for updated appraisal data. This is to ensure the Public Art Division can determine whether restoration costs would exceed the value of the artwork.\n\nAlthough the condition of art is not regularly evaluated, existing condition data from the City Art Collection Database shows that many of the City’s artworks are in need of repair or restoration. Condition information exists for 867 works of art. Of those artworks, 646 artworks were in excellent, good, or fair condition. However, 221 (25 percent) were in poor condition or had some type of damage. Examples of damage to artworks include holes, tears, stains, warping, and water damage. For some artworks, materials have deteriorated over time, while some works are dirty or worn down.\n\nWhile resource constraints make it unlikely the City will ever be able to restore all items in the collection, special care should be taken to ensure the City’s most valuable and historically significant collection items are in good condition, and available for public display. For example, in 2015, the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL), working in conjunction with the Public Art Division, sought to restore eight preparatory sketches by Dean Cornwell. The sketches are associated with the murals in the Grand Rotunda of the Los Angeles Central Library.\n\nThe Cornwell sketches are charcoal, graphite, and chalk sketches on paper, and were likely completed sometime between 1927 and 1932. Prior to 2015, these sketches were stored in the City Art Collection storage room in City Hall. Despite these sketches being both valuable and historic, conservation experts hired by LAPL and the Public Art Division found the sketches to be in poor condition. The drawings had suffered compound tears and punctures, as well as extensive water damage, acid degradation, and mold damage. None were deemed suitable for public display.\n\nThe estimated cost to restore the eight sketches was approximately $16,000. The cost to professionally frame the artworks in plexiglass and moldings was $17,500. These sketches, which highlight the need to restore and protect significant artworks, will soon be on display at the Central Library.\n\nTHE CITY DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS TO REMOVE ART FROM ITS COLLECTION\n\nCurrently, no formal policy exists which allows for the deaccessioning of City artworks.  Deaccessioning is the process by which an organization, typically through sale or donation, officially removes art or artifacts from a collection. According to DCA managers, some of the City’s art may be suitable for deaccessioning. The development of a formal deaccessioning process would allow DCA to remove items from the collection that no longer add value, or are damaged to a degree where restoration is either cost prohibitive or not possible.\n\nSeveral factors should be considered when determining whether to remove an item from an art collection. The Association of Art Museum Directors advises art managers to consider whether items are:\n\nOf sufficient monetary value to retain;\nOf sufficient historical value to retain;\nOf poor or modest quality; or\nIn such poor condition that restoration is impossible.\n\nA deaccessioning policy could increase the efficiency of DCA’s management of art assets because staff would no longer need to dedicate time and resources – whether it be for inventories, loans, or restoration – to art of little or no value. Any formal deaccessioning process should involve the Cultural Affairs Commission, as the LAAC stipulates that no existing work of art may be removed, relocated, or altered without the Commission’s approval.\n\n[3] City Art Collection Database records are not fully reliable, as DCA has not been able to keep all of the information up to date. This database will be discussed in greater detail later in this report. The number of missing items was estimated using records with a location identified as “Unable to Locate,” “Missing,” “Not Found,” “Stolen,” or “Unknown.” An additional 110 artworks have no location identified in the database’s location field, but are not confirmed as missing items.\n\n[4] City-owned art is insured up to $15 million, with some exceptions. The City Administrative Officer administers the City’s fine art insurance policy.\n\nMODERNIZING THE CITY'S ARTWORK MANAGEMENT TOOLS\n\nThe ability to maintain accurate, current data about the City Art Collection, as well as public art owned by proprietary departments, is central to establishing an effective stewardship program. When art managers have information about the location, history, and qualities of a work of art, it allows them to develop tailored maintenance and care plans which conserve and protect the artwork. It also enables art managers to hold organizations in possession of loaned artworks accountable for keeping artworks in good condition.\n\nThe importance of current and reliable information about artworks highlights the need for DCA’s art managers to have tools which allow the department to easily track art asset data. DCA acknowledges that their current approach to managing information about the City Art Collection is inadequate and creating information gaps. Information about other types of art – such as public art (e.g., sculptures, murals, and other public installations) and artwork controlled by the City’s proprietary departments – is spread out across multiple databases and spreadsheets.\n\nThe chart below describes where the City houses its art data, as well as the department responsible for maintaining the information and the type of application used to track the data.[5]\n\nThe reliance on older systems makes management of both artwork data – and the artworks themselves – more difficult. In contrast, other public agencies have shifted toward using modern art collection management systems with integrated inventory tracking and maintenance management features.\n\nDCA’S CITY ART COLLECTION DATABASE\n\nThe DCA Public Art Division has struggled to keep the City Art Collection Database up to date. There are 2,512 artworks and artifacts reflected in the City Art Collection Database. This database contains large amounts of valuable information, such as artworks’ title, age, medium or material, measurements, and last known location. It also contains information about the artists, and the person, organization, or government entity that gifted the art to the City.\n\nAlthough the database provides useful information about the City’s art, some fields are either incomplete or outdated. More than 2,000 artworks have no acquisition date listed, and approximately 1,030 records contain no identifying photograph. Photographs of collection items not only help to facilitate inventories by helping staffers to identify works of art, but are vital should art be stolen. According to the LAPD, photographs of stolen or missing pieces are often necessary in order to investigate and recover art.\n\nThe City Art Collection Database is a Microsoft Access database which was configured to manage and store City art data. According to Public Art Division managers, some of the gaps in information were caused when data from the preceding collection tracking system, known as I/O, was transferred into the Microsoft Access system. Public Art Division managers have considered replacing the City Art Collection database with a newer collection management software. However, DCA managers said they did not have sufficient resources to carry out the implementation of a new art management application.\n\nDCA’S PUBLIC ART DATABASE\n\nThe DCA Public Art Division also maintains a separate Microsoft Access database, known as the Public Art Database, to track public art installations commissioned through the Public Works Improvements Arts Program. The Public Works Improvements Arts Program was established by ordinance in 1989. DCA’s Public Art Database contains information about the artist, location, type of work, and when the artwork was completed. The database also tracks project management information, such as the value of the contract with the artists, the funding source, and copyright ownership.\n\nThere are 231 public art installations listed with a status of “active” or “completed” in the database for projects dating back to 1995. This database does not include public art commissioned prior to the establishment of the City’s public art programs, and therefore is not considered to be a comprehensive database reflecting all of the City’s public art.\n\nPROPRIETARY DEPARTMENT INVENTORIES\n\nBoth Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) and the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) have some inventory information related to artworks and artifacts owned by their respective departments, but the inventories are somewhat informal.\n\nLAWA maintains its art inventory records in an Excel spreadsheet which lists the artworks in each LAX terminal, as well as artworks on LAX grounds. The inventory spreadsheet contains 17 records, and includes information about the artworks’ location, qualities, and condition. LAWA’s art program also facilitates temporary art exhibitions to improve travelers’ airport experience. These exhibitions typically feature loaned artworks, which are not listed in LAWA’s inventory spreadsheet.\n\nAccording to POLA managers, the department owns very few portable works, with the exception of approximately half a dozen paintings displayed in the POLA Administration Building. POLA does not maintain an art inventory, but it does maintain records for its archives. The archives house a variety of the Port’s historic records, maps, photographs, and other artifacts, though these items are not considered to be art by the department.\n\nTECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE ART MORE ACCESSIBLE AND EASIER TO CURATE\n\nThe City’s art managers would benefit from the implementation of a new, comprehensive art collection management application which would make it easier to track the location, condition, and care needs of artworks. The ability to manage this information within one application, as opposed to multiple databases and spreadsheets, would improve the ability of DCA staff to manage art data, and make informed decisions on how to best care for works of art.\n\nMany local jurisdictions are opting to purchase off-the-shelf collection management applications which are available to museums and arts organizations. Specifically, a centralized application would facilitate:\n\nConsolidation of information for each work of art into one reference tool;\nTracking artwork loan lifecycles;\nTracking artwork locations, including location histories;\nTracking maintenance and restoration needs;\nManagement of artwork images; and\nAn improved ability to curate and display artworks for public viewings.\n\nA new collection management system would also facilitate the publication of interactive, web-based inventory tools which would allow members of the public to learn about City artworks. Currently DCA does not have any kind of online database which would allow the public to explore what art is owned by the City, and where the art is showcased. Currently, DCA’s method of providing artwork information to Angelenos and other members of the community is via phone and email. Other jurisdictions with art collections are transitioning to collection management systems that allow for publication of online inventories of publicly-owned art.\n\nDCA needs to consider how it can best make information about City-owned art available to the public. Making information about publicly-owned artworks accessible is a key aspect of ensuring members of the community can enjoy City-owned art, and learn about the City’s rich history.\n\n[5] The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power did not provide any art collection records at the time of this review.\n\nLESSONS FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS\n\nOther jurisdictions offer lessons in what steps DCA can take to re-establish the City Art Collection program, as well as improve oversight of public and proprietary department artworks. The City of San Diego and Los Angeles County have taken major steps to reshape the way they manage art and rare items. The organizations have undertaken a methodical effort to evaluate their collection of artworks and rare items, and are taking steps to improve the way they collect and manages data.   \n\nCITY OF SAN DIEGO COMMISSION FOR ARTS AND CULTURE\n\nThe City of San Diego’s Commission for Arts and Culture has completed several phases of a multistage project to inventory and evaluate all items in its Civic Art Collection. San Diego’s Civic Art Collection is comprised of approximately 800 works, and includes both public art installations and portable works. Although the city had existing records and information regarding its art, Commission for Arts and Culture Managers sought to build a new inventory from the ground up.\n\nSan Diego enlisted the assistance of a contract registrar to build its new art inventory. Contract registrars typically manage the movement of art in museums and galleries, and implement policies related to collection management. San Diego’s contract registrar worked with the commission’s art managers to inventory each collection item, create a comprehensive digital photograph record for all artworks, and evaluate the condition of all public art installations. As part of the initiative, art managers also selected an off-the-shelf digital collection management system. According to the city’s art managers, the collection management application costs less than $10,000 annually, and includes cloud based storage of collection data.\n\nThe completion of a new inventory and implementation of the new collection management system took approximately two years. A map of city artworks, as well as information about the artworks and artists, is now publicly available on the city’s web page. The city plans to begin a condition assessment of all portable artworks in early 2020.\n\nCurrently, a Senior Public Art Manager is responsible for managing the City of San Diego’s Civic Art Collection, and the commission continues to employee a contract registrar to support day to day management of the collection. The Commission for Arts and Culture reported that its annual budget for managing the city’s art collection is approximately $280,000, which includes funding for its collection management system, collection maintenance and conservation, transportation and handling, and the storage of select artworks at an offsite facility.\n\nLOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE\n\nBeginning in 2015, the Los Angeles County Department of Arts and Culture sought to create a new baseline inventory to account for artworks owned by the County, and make the information accessible to both employees and community members. The initiative has progressed in two major phases.\n\nDuring the first phase, a contract registrar conducted field research to: (1) document the condition of known works of art; (2) identify the County’s uncatalogued art assets and document the condition of those artworks; and (3) develop a prioritized list of conservation needs. Between 2015 and 2017, the contract registrar visited all County properties likely to contain artworks, and used an electronic tablet to collect data about the identified works of art. The registrar identified more than 1,500 new artworks, and updated the condition information for nearly 200 known pieces. County staff will continue to research the origins and artistic value of the newly discovered works. They will then determine whether artworks should be added to the Civic Art Collection based on the department’s Civic Art Criteria guidelines.\n\nIn its second phase, County art managers are working to implement a risk management and artwork preservation program to support the sustained preservation of County-owned art. This includes:\n\nLeveraging the County’s existing maintenance management systems to support artwork maintenance planning;\nDeveloping a crowdsourcing strategy to assist with artwork monitoring; and\nTraining County staff on how to care for collection items.\n\nArtwork restoration will take place subject to available funds, and in accordance with maintenance priorities established during the first phase.\n\nSimilar to the City of San Diego, Los Angeles County’s Department of Arts and Culture is using an off-the-shelf collection management application to track its Civic Art Collection. Two County employees, a Civic Art Conservation and Collections Manager and a Civic Art Registrar, are responsible for managing the Civic Art Collection and the ongoing baseline inventory and conservation initiative. The department funded its inventory project through a one-time budget allocation of $240,000.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo ensure DCA can continue to connect Angelenos to accessible, high quality artworks and cultural items, the City should focus on reviving the City’s art collection program, and improve the way it manages these unique items. As City Policymakers make funding decisions related to arts programs, it is important to recognize the need to re-establish and modernize the City’s artwork management program.\n\nTo improve the City’s ability to protect and care for City-owned art, DCA, in collaboration with Proprietary Departments, should:\n\nDevelop an updated, comprehensive inventory of City-owned art which includes the City Art Collection, public art, and portable and public artworks belonging to proprietary departments.   \nIn developing an updated inventory, the department should evaluate, to the greatest extent possible, the condition of each work of art and the associated conservation needs.\nDCA should also update appraisal information for City artworks to ensure art managers have an improved understanding of the value of items, and whether any special precautions are necessary for particular works. DCA should focus on items known to have a higher value, and should also take steps to determine which artworks that are currently not appraised may warrant a formal appraisal.\nImplement a new collection management system to improve DCA’s ability to track artworks’ location, loan history, and condition. The technology should also include the ability to integrate digital images, track maintenance lifecycles, and monitor artwork loan lifecycles.\nDevelop an online catalog and map of City-owned artworks enabling the public to learn about artworks and artifacts, and where those items are on display to increase transparency and make works more accessible.\nDevelop a formal deaccessioning policy that allows art managers to identify and release art that no longer adds value, or has become too costly to maintain.\nWhen deaccessioning items, DCA should consider whether the artworks or artifacts should be donated to an organization that will serve as a responsible conservator and steward.\nEstablish an inventory monitoring program which certifies on an ongoing basis that the City’s artworks, especially those on loan to City departments and external organizations, are accounted for and maintained in accordance with loan agreements.\nTo the greatest extent possible, leverage the subject matter expertise of local arts organizations, academic institutions, and other experts within the community as it works to inventory, evaluate, and showcase City works of art.\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\nNumber\tSummary of Recommendations\tResponsible Entity\n1\tDevelop an updated, comprehensive inventory of City-owned art which includes the City Art Collection, public art, and portable and public artworks belonging to proprietary departments.\n\na.      In developing an updated inventory, the department should evaluate, to the greatest extent possible, the condition of each work of art and the associated conservation needs.\n\nb.      DCA should also update appraisal information for City artworks to ensure art managers have an improved understanding of the value of items, and whether any special precautions are necessary for particular works.

As of the end of this quarter, the FWA Unit has a total of 84 open cases.\n\nThe FWA Unit’s evaluation of the 132 cases received between January and March 2020 determined that 78 (59 percent) were outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and did not merit any further action. Of the remaining cases, the FWA Unit referred 19 to other City departments or agencies. Thirty-five cases were deemed to require an investigation: 22 were referred to departments, and the FWA Unit retained jurisdiction over 13 for further review.\n\nDuring this quarter, the FWA Unit closed 120 cases. Seventy-nine were found to be outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and did not merit further action. Of the 41 other cases closed, 25 were non-FWA investigative matters requiring department action. The FWA Unit found the complaint allegations to be unsubstantiated in 13 cases and substantiated in three.\n\n \n\nEXAMPLES OF CASES CLOSED THIS QUARTER\nAccounting Irregularities: An employee did not follow proper departmental procedures for cash handling and reporting which was identified during the cash reconciliation process. The department promptly investigated the variance and located the funds that were not stored in the proper cash vault. The employee was disciplined and provided additional training. The department made updates to the cash handling process as a result of the investigation.\nUnreported Outside Employment: A department pursued personnel action against an employee for failing to report outside employment.\n\nTheft of time was the leading type of issue reported for cases received during the quarter, which accounted for nine of the 32 cases determined to require an investigation or additional review.\n\nThe breakdown of cases requiring investigation or review by departments and the number of cases referred to departments for action are as follows:\n\n \n\nMETRICS\n\nThis quarter, the majority of cases received were reported anonymously. Most cases were received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through the web intake form or hotline phone calls. A small number of additional cases were received via email, U.S. mail or in-person.\n\n\nThe FWA Unit has received 132 cases for both the first quarter of the year in 2020 and 2019, compared to receiving 78 cases during the same period in 2018. The increase in cases received in the first quarter of 2019 was attributed to the enhanced Fraud Awareness Training deployed to all City departments and offices, combined with the FWA Unit’s outreach and in-person FWA training given to employees."

      "textofpage": "Cover Letter\n\nFebruary 19, 2020\n\nHonorable Eric Garcetti, Mayor\nHonorable Michael Feuer, City Attorney\nHonorable Members of the Los Angeles City Council\n\nRe: On the Lookout: Fraud, Waste and Abuse Annual Report\n\nThe Controller’s Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) Unit seeks to identify and, ultimately, prevent the misuse of City resources by employees, contractors and others. We do this through our 24-hour telephone hotline and web-based complaint form, citywide education and training programs, and proactive investigations. The activity of the FWA Unit in 2019 is the subject of this report.\n\nLast year, 33,670 City employees completed our newly enhanced fraud awareness training. As a result, my office’s FWA Unit fielded 543 new complaints, 58 percent more than the year prior, and closed 541 cases, with 23 complaints substantiated and 155 referred to City departments for further action. The most frequent complaint was theft of time, accounting for 21 percent of all cases.\n\nExamples of FWA Unit results:\n\nDiscovered suspected equipment theft at LAPD and made recommendations for policy changes, resulting in improved department inventory controls.\nFound instances of falsified employee time cards and unauthorized discounts given to employees and others, leading to disciplinary actions and termination.\nInvestigated an employee for alleged falsified absence documentation, prompting the employee’s resignation and referral to the City’s Ethics Commission.\n\nAs stewards of the public’s trust, we have a shared responsibility to hold City departments and all employees to the highest standards of service. My office will continue to do everything possible with the resources available to reduce fraud, waste and abuse of our vital public resources.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nRON GALPERIN\nL.A. Controller\n\nReport\n\nThe Office of the City Controller’s Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) Unit was established to screen, monitor, and investigate allegations of FWA involving City resources. To help support the integrity of City operations, the Unit receives, analyzes, investigates, and reports on allegations of FWA that impact City resources.\n\nDuring 2019, the FWA Unit received 543 cases, compared to 343 cases received in the prior year, representing an increase of 58%. This increase may be attributed to the enhanced Fraud Awareness Training developed by the FWA Unit and deployed to all City staff as part of the City’s required bi-annual training curriculum.  In addition, the FWA Unit has been proactively reaching out to all City departments and staff to ensure they remain knowledgeable in understanding and identifying fraud, waste and abuse in an everyday work setting.  The City’s definition of Fraud, Waste and Abuse is as follows:\n\nFRAUD\tAny intentional act or omission designed to deprive the City of its resources to which the individual or person is not entitled, including but not limited to making false statements or submitting false documents, withholding or misrepresenting material facts, bribery, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential procurement documents.\nWASTE\tThe extravagant or excessive expenditure of City funds above and beyond the level that is reasonably required to meet the needs of the City or the consumption or use of City resources that is not knowingly authorized.\nABUSE\tThe improper use of City resources in a manner contrary to law or City policy or the improper use of one’s position for private gain or advantage for themselves or any other person where not otherwise lawful.\n\n \n\nCase Intake Methods\n\nThe FWA Unit may receive cases from any City department, Office, or employee, as well as any member of the public. Cases are primarily received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through a web intake form that can be accessed at lacontroller.org/fraud_hotline or hotline phone number (866) 428-1514.\n\nAny person submitting a complaint or allegation to the FWA Unit may do so anonymously. The City’s Ethics Ordinance protects whistleblowers who report or attempt to report possible violations of law from retaliation. Any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to whistleblower retaliation may file a confidential complaint with the City Ethics Commission, which shall investigate and take appropriate action. Specific information regarding FWA Unit investigations may not be disclosed except as necessary to conduct the investigations, carry out referrals for appropriate action, or as required by law.\n\nDuring 2019, the majority of cases received were reported anonymously. Most cases were received through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through the web intake form or hotline phone calls. A small number of additional cases were received via email, U.S. mail, or in-person.\n\nExcept as prohibited by applicable law, Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 20.60.4 requires City departments and appointed Offices to report to the Controller’s Office FWA Unit matters involving potential FWA within ten days of discovery of information that reasonably indicates that the matter involves FWA of City resources.\n\nCase Evaluation Process\n\nThe FWA Unit completes an evaluation of every case received. The evaluation includes a thorough review of all information submitted by the reporting party and can include a review of City or other public databases and other information to thoughtfully evaluate the allegations. After completing the evaluation, the FWA Unit will determine whether the allegations: 1) are outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and/or have no FWA allegations; 2) are non-FWA investigative matters requiring referral to another City department or other jurisdiction for appropriate action; or 3) are FWA investigative matters requiring investigation or review to be conducted by the FWA Unit or a City department. The FWA Unit may also conduct joint investigations with other entities as appropriate.\n\nCases evaluated as outside the FWA Unit’s jurisdiction are those that are either unrelated to City operations, involve personnel related matters, and/or cases in which there are no FWA allegations. Nevertheless, cases may be referred to the appropriate outside agency or City department for review. For example, a number of cases were received related to phone scammers posing as utility employees; the cases were referred to LADWP and/or law enforcement as appropriate. After the FWA Unit makes the referral, the case is considered closed for no further action by the FWA Unit. A case may also be closed for no further action if the risk reported has been addressed through a City policy change or if it is the subject of ongoing litigation, in which case it will be referred to the Office of the City Attorney.\n\nCases evaluated as requiring referral to another City department or other jurisdiction for appropriate action are non-FWA investigative matters. These cases are best suited for the department to take action but do not warrant an investigation. Examples include minor employee misconduct and/or customer service operations.\n\nCases evaluated as FWA investigative matters requiring investigation or review are those that have sufficient information either through the FWA Unit’s research into the allegations or documentation provided by the reporting party that provides a reasonable basis that an FWA matter occurred or is still occurring. The FWA Unit may assign a case to a City department for investigation based on those that have a lower sensitivity level of the allegations, if the case relies more heavily on factual supported records (i.e., invoices or contracts) versus relying on information gathered through interviews, and amount of resources required. Due to current resource constraints, the FWA Unit has referred the majority of investigative cases to City departments to conduct the investigation.\n\nThe FWA Unit’s evaluation of the 543 cases received during the year is summarized in the following chart.\n\nThe following highlights several key outcomes from substantiated cases during the year for fraud, waste and abuse related reviews and investigations conducted by or in collaboration with the FWA Unit:\n\nTheft (Fraud)\n\nA report from a state law enforcement authority was made to the FWA hotline to report that a City employee was obtaining sensitive information while carrying out their job duties for personal use. The investigation resulted in the employee resigning in lieu of termination and the case was referred to LAPD for criminal investigation.\nA report was made by a City department to the FWA Unit regarding suspected theft of equipment identified during a review of purchase card transactions. The case was reported to LAPD for investigation while the FWA Unit investigated department inventory controls. As a result, the FWA Unit provided recommendations resulting in establishing policy changes that included creating an improved system of inventory tracking and implemented periodic inventory counts.\nA hotline tip alleged a City employee was holding on to complementary admission tickets for personal benefit that were designated to be distributed to non-profit organizations. The investigation found that the employee was not holding the tickets for personal benefit but had been using improper procedures for maintaining the ticket inventory. As a result of the investigation, the complementary ticket program was suspended while the department assessed its current business practices and conducted retraining of assigned employees. The employee under investigation was counseled by the department and given additional training on performance management over assigned tasks.\n\nMisuse of Authority (Abuse)\n\nAn investigation prompted by a hotline tip found that a City employee gave unauthorized discounts to employees and volunteers which violated Department policy resulting in an estimated loss of $11,275. The employee resigned prior to the start of the investigation. The investigation resulted in procedural changes being implemented with greater oversight that amounts due are paid in full.\nA City department reported an employee’s alleged misuse of authority to the FWA Unit. During the investigation, it was revealed that the employee had accessed and tampered with a departmental system database for personal reasons. In addition the investigation also found the employee had falsified timecard entries. As a result, the employee was discharged by the department based on the investigation findings.\nA reporter submitted a hotline tip that they had observed a City work truck parked at a residence. The case was investigated by the relevant City department which identified the employee assigned to that truck on the reported date. The investigation findings resulted in the employee receiving a suspension for unauthorized usage of a City vehicle.\n\nPurchase Card (Fraud)\n\nThe FWA Unit identified that tickets purchased for a Department’s authorized external event exceeded the number of registered attendees. The investigation into the overage found that other events had similar variances in the overage of number of tickets purchased. The purchase card holder resigned prior to the start of the investigation. The investigation resulted in proposed control recommendations to the Department related to the event ticket purchase process.\nThe FWA Unit initiated a follow-up review into the purchase card status of employees that had resigned or were terminated as a result of the investigations. The FWA Unit identified that in some instances, the employee’s purchase card remained active after the employee was no longer an active City employee. The FWA Unit promptly notified the affected City department who then took action to cancel the purchase card. Further, the department reviewed their separation checklist procedures related to purchase card cancellation.\n\nPayroll (Fraud)\n\nSeveral cases were reported to the FWA Unit regarding allegations of employees not working the hours reported on their timecard. Cases were referred to the appropriate City department for investigation. Outcome of the investigations resulted in varying degrees of employee disciplinary action with one case resulting in the resignation of the employee.\nA hotline tip reported a City employee submitted falsified documentation to cover absences from work. The investigation resulted in the resignation of the employee and case was referred to Ethics Commission.\n\nWorkers’ Compensation (Fraud)\n\nThere were five cases reported to the FWA Unit during the year alleging Workers’ Compensation Fraud against three Civilian and two Sworn employees. The FWA Unit does not have jurisdiction over these cases as there is a dedicated City Workers’ Compensation Division of the Personnel Department that investigates allegations of Workers’ Compensation Fraud. These cases were referred to the Workers’ Compensation Division for investigation and follow-up. These cases take significant time to investigate and outcomes are confidential.\n\nCaseload Status\n\nThe following chart summarizes caseload status count for the calendar year.\n\nDuring this year, the FWA Unit closed a total of 541 cases. The case closure by category is summarized in the following chart.\n\nCase Analysis by Issue Type\n\nTheft of time was the leading type of issue reported for cases received during the year, which accounted for 55 of the 268 cases determined to require investigation or review by departments and referred to departments for action.\n\nCase Analysis by Location\n\nThe cases requiring investigation or review by departments and number of cases referred to departments for action are as follows:\n\nFile a Report\nReport fraud, waste, and abuse of City resources and operations by contacting the Controller’s FWA Unit.\n\nFWA Web Intake Form:\nhttp://www.lacontroller.org/fraud_hotline\n\nFWA 24-7 Hotline:\n(866) 428-1514\n\nFWA Complaint by Mail:\nOffice of the Controller\nAttention: FWA Unit\n200 N.

      "textofpage": "Report\n\nAs a full-service municipal government, the City of Los Angeles strives to provide high-quality services to all residents equally. Because of the significant challenges many Angelenos face — living paycheck to paycheck or on fixed incomes, while housing costs continue to climb — greater assistance for some of our most vulnerable residents is required to ensure access to vital public services. The City offers two programs to help ease the weight of utility costs on income-eligible residents: the Low-Income Discount Program (LIDP) and Lifeline Program (Lifeline). My latest report covers the reach and efficacy of these programs and urges the City to make changes that will improve outreach, enrollment and oversight.\n\nEach bar below contains a section of the report. Click on any to expand and read the full text of the section. Click again to collapse.\n\nCOVER LETTER\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMany Angelenos are struggling to make ends meet and have difficulty paying bills for water, electricity, gas, sewer, and trash removal. Residents’ health and quality of life depend on maintaining access to these essential services – but many households cannot afford to do so without financial assistance.\n\nThe City offers help to ease the burden of utility costs on income-eligible residents through two programs: (A) the Low-Income Discount Program (LIDP); and (B) the Lifeline Program. LIDP provides enrolled customers with discounted service fees, and Lifeline provides a combination of discounted service fees and exemptions from local utility user taxes.[1] Over the last three fiscal years, the City issued an average of $72 million per year in financial assistance through LIDP ($29.6 million) and Lifeline ($42.5 million).\n\nWe found that the City can do more to connect vulnerable residents to help. In addition, the City is not doing enough to identify and remove enrolled customers who no longer qualify for financial assistance. Specifically, our review identified the following issues.\n\nMissed outreach opportunities – The Department of Water and Power (LADWP) does not analyze its billing data to identify and initiate contact with customers whose energy usage or payment patterns suggest that they are having difficulty paying their bills. In addition, there are opportunities to make the programs more inclusive and accessible.\nIneffective performance measurement – The City does not manage LIDP and Lifeline using metrics that provide insight into the effectiveness of its efforts. Counting the number of participants should be the bare minimum – measuring how many and which income-eligible Angelenos are not enrolled would provide significantly greater insight that can be used to set goals, develop outreach strategies, and improve the programs.\nInadequate oversight – More than seven years has passed since the City required customers enrolled in Lifeline to certify their continued eligibility for financial assistance – and this process was limited to half of the total number of customers enrolled in Lifeline. In addition, we identified several gaps in the City’s administration of both Lifeline and LIDP that increase the likelihood that discounts are being erroneously issued.\nRecommendations\n\nWe recommend that City Policymakers establish a working group – consisting of LADWP and other departments – and instruct them to take the following steps to resolve these issues.\n\nBetter outreach – LADWP should analyze its billing data and initiate contact with customers to: (1) determine if they qualify for LIDP or Lifeline; and (2) inform them about opportunities to lower utility bills by making their homes more energy/water efficient. In addition, steps should be taken to make it easier for all residents to learn about the programs and submit applications.\nImprove performance measurement and reporting – The working group should develop better tools to evaluate how LIDP/Lifeline are performing, and LADWP – with the assistance of the Bureau of Sanitation and Office of Finance – should submit annual reports that detail progress toward goals established by Policymakers and subject matter experts.\nStrengthen program integrity – The working group should streamline the recertification process in order to lower administrative costs for both programs, and identify sources of funding that can be used to implement improved safeguards.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the programs and calculated annual averages using data from the last three fiscal years.[2]\n\nLIDP and Lifeline are primarily administered by LADWP, but the City’s Office of Finance, Bureau of Sanitation, and multiple non-City utilities (i.e., SoCalGas and various telecommunication companies) also have important roles. Together, these entities are responsible for conducting outreach, screening customer applications to verify eligibility, activating discounts/tax exemptions, and billing for services. This report is intended to provide recommendations to help the City improve its utility discount programs and better serve vulnerable Angelenos.\n\nIMPROVING OUTREACH AND PROGRAM IMPACT\n\nDiscount programs like LIDP and Lifeline can make a difference – but only if eligible customers know that financial assistance is available. The City primarily uses conventional approaches such as printed materials, website placement, and partnerships with community-based organizations to notify customers about its programs. In addition, LADWP customer service representatives are trained to offer information about discount programs when customers call to activate utility service. While these represent the foundation of an effective outreach strategy, the City can do more.  \n\nProactive and targeted outreach – LADWP’s billing system includes vast amounts of data about which customers are likely experiencing financial difficulties (e.g., multiple shutoff notices within a year) but are not enrolled in LIDP or Lifeline. Lower income customers also tend to live in older homes that consume more energy – LADWP has access to information about which households have high electricity/water usage patterns and may be good candidates for energy efficiency upgrades (e.g., low flow showerheads and LED lighting) offered by the utility or entities such as the federal government.\n\nConnecting eligible customers to each type of program is essential to lowering monthly utility costs. However, LADWP does not leverage its billing data to initiate contact with customers who are not enrolled in LIDP or Lifeline and would most likely benefit from financial and weatherization assistance.\n\nBeyond mining the available data to initiate direct contact via telephone or email, the City should include printed information about discount programs and weatherization opportunities in mailings to potentially-qualified customers who receive overdue bill notices or service disconnection warnings.\n\nMeasuring effectiveness and reporting results – LADWP is collecting data that primarily measures activity levels (e.g., number of community events attended and number of new participants). While these metrics are important, they do not answer critical questions about the effectiveness of the City’s outreach efforts or the overall impact of the discount programs.\n\nIn contrast, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) requires investor-owned utilities to produce annual reports to demonstrate their progress against established goals. One important metric – referred to as penetration rate – compares the estimated number of eligible low-income customers within a utility’s service territory to the number of customers enrolled in customer assistance programs. CPUC has established a penetration rate goal of 90 percent for investor-owned utilities. The City does not actively manage its utility discount programs using a similar approach.[3]\n\nBeyond outreach, there are opportunities to determine the extent to which the financial assistance provided to customers enrolled in LIDP or Lifeline is making a difference. For example, how many customers enrolled in the programs are still receiving shutoff notices? What percentage of LIDP and Lifeline customers are also participating in the City’s energy efficiency and conservation programs? Formally tracking and reporting these types of metrics allows Policymakers to consider changes to the programs.\n\nIn December 2016, LADWP began periodically reporting high-level participation data on LIDP and Lifeline through its Equity Metrics Data Initiative, but there are opportunities to do more to maximize transparency and program effectiveness. For example, the reporting does not use comprehensive evaluative measures and does not set annual goals against which performance is measured.\n\nThe City can also use qualitative information – collected through formal surveys and informal methods such as customer complaints/inquiries – to better manage its discount programs. Currently, this information is collected on an ad hoc basis.[4]\n\nPrioritizing inclusion and accessibility – We identified several issues that indicate the City must do more to reach all Angelenos – especially those who have accessibility challenges or face language barriers.\n\nApplications for LIDP can be submitted through LADWP’s website. In contrast, residents interested in enrolling in Lifeline must submit applications – and confidential proof of age/income/disability documents – through the mail or in-person at the Office of Finance’s City Hall location during business hours. The Office of Finance is shifting to online Lifeline applications in the coming months.\nInformation about the City’s utility discount programs is only offered in English and Spanish, which may exclude residents whose primary language is Chinese, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian, Vietnamese, Persian, Japanese, or other commonly spoken languages in Los Angeles.\nThe City’s outreach strategies do not sufficiently target residents with disabilities who have vision, hearing, or other impairments.\nThe City is not cross-promoting information about LIDP and Lifeline through departments (e.g., Aging, Disability, Housing and Community Investment) that regularly engage with similar target populations.\n\nInvestor-owned utilities throughout the State have made progress on similar issues based on guidance from the CPUC; the City should look to these programs as a model.\n\nRecommendations – City Policymakers should:\n\nCreate a working group consisting of representatives from LADWP, Finance, and Sanitation to collaborate on improving outreach and evaluation activities related to the City’s utility discount programs, and instruct them to carry out the following tasks.\nUse billing data to proactively identify and contact customers who are likely to qualify for discounted utility bills. Provide these customers with information about LIDP/Lifeline and opportunities to lower bills through energy/water efficiency upgrades.\nDevelop an improved performance measurement framework that allows the City to evaluate whether its outreach efforts are successful and whether the programs are resulting in better outcomes for Angelenos in need of assistance.\nRefine the current outreach strategy to include information in additional languages, easy access for residents with disabilities or mobility challenges, and incorporate input from subject matter experts such as the Department of Aging, Department on Disability, and Office of Public Accountability.\nEstablish performance goals and require relevant departments to submit annual reports detailing their efforts and strategies for improvement.\nGUARDING AGAINST FRAUD AND PREVENTING WASTE\n\nThe City also needs to improve oversight of LIDP and Lifeline. Because utility discount programs provide financial benefits, they are susceptible to fraud. Effective administration of the programs by City departments is required to decrease the likelihood that customers who are no longer eligible continue to receive discounts. Preventing fraud and waste are especially important because every dollar that is issued to someone who does not meet the eligibility threshold is a dollar that is not available to someone who does.\n\nA 2010 study by the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) found that 9 percent of households that received benefits through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) should not have received the benefits.[5] During the course of this review, we identified gaps in the City’s administration of its customer assistance programs – primarily Lifeline – that suggest a lack of comprehensive safeguards in place to protect ratepayer funds.\n\nCustomers living at a service address can continue receiving discounts through Lifeline even though the original applicant who qualified for the program passed away several years ago.\nA loophole in screening processes for LIDP and Lifeline can allow customers to receive unauthorized water discounts.\nCustomers are able to use their discount eligibility to enroll non-primary service addresses in Lifeline or LIDP.\n\nAddressing these issues will allow the City to strengthen the programs and direct financial assistance to those who need it most. The City should exercise caution while implementing the strategies below in order to avoid inadvertently removing eligible customers.\n\nRecertifying customers for continued eligibility – A best practice for utilities that offer discount programs is to periodically verify that customers who are enrolled still qualify for financial assistance. This process – typically referred to as “recertification” – allows utilities to remove customers who are no longer eligible and make those benefits available for others. Recent data reported by the State’s three largest IOUs showed that the recertification process eliminated more than 20 percent of participants.\n\nIn order to receive utility discounts through Lifeline, customers must meet the required income threshold and provide documentation that they are either disabled or at least 62 years of age. These customers may not experience changes to their income level at the same frequency as customers enrolled in LIDP – but circumstances change and it is the City’s responsibility to effectively monitor the program.\n\nMore than seven years have passed since the City last conducted a recertification of Lifeline participants.[6] In addition, the last recertification process excluded nearly half of the customers registered in Lifeline. The primary reason a recertification has not occurred is because the City did not allocate the necessary funding for the effort.[7]\n\nAs a result, an unknown number of customer accounts are receiving financial assistance even though: (1) the customer no longer qualifies for assistance; or (2) they are deceased and discounts are being passed along to someone who has not been screened for eligibility.\n\nRecertifying Lifeline customers should be prioritized given the amount of discounts issued. On average, each Lifeline customer received twice the amount of discounts that LIDP customers received. In addition, Lifeline customers received approximately 59 percent of total discounts issued in the last three fiscal years ($128 million) while accounting for 35 percent of overall enrollment between both programs.\n\nBecause all three City departments (LADWP, Finance, and Sanitation) responsible for administering Lifeline discounts cited the cost as the primary reason for discontinuing recertifications, we identified strategies to help streamline the process.\n\nDatasets generated by the federal entities such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) or non-governmental entities can be cross-referenced with Lifeline participants to identify accounts that are potentially no longer eligible.\nImproving information-sharing across City departments and private utilities would help make timely changes to customer accounts and generate revenue.\n\nRegardless which approach the City uses, it is critical that periodic and comprehensive recertifications are conducted for LIDP and Lifeline.\n\nSecondary reviews of discount activations – Beyond recertifications, LADWP and Finance do not periodically test accounts enrolled in its customer assistance programs to determine whether the discounts/tax exemptions were activated in accordance with program requirements. Customer service representatives are authorized to activate discounts without a secondary or supervisory approval, which increases the likelihood that unauthorized benefits are being issued.\n\nFor example, 150 LADWP customer service representatives have access to the module in the billing system that activates discounts, but only 11 representatives are actually trained and authorized to review applications. While it may not be feasible or cost effective to test all enrolled accounts, a representative sample would likely provide additional assurance about program integrity.\n\nRestricting utility discounts to primary residences – LADWP and Finance noted that the programs are designed to provide enrolled customers with discounts at their primary residential address. However, during the course of this review we identified instances of the same customers receiving LIDP or Lifeline discounts at multiple service addresses. The City should resolve these oversight gaps to ensure that customers do not abuse the program.\n\nRecommendations – City Policymakers should:\n\n3. Instruct the working group (as outlined in Recommendation #1) to carry out the following tasks.\n\nIdentify sources of funding and recertify participants in the Lifeline program in order to remove customers who are no longer eligible to participate.\nStreamline and improve the recertification process by leveraging existing third-party data, use a risk-based framework to identify ineligible customers, and improve coordination across departments.\nStrengthen protocols to mitigate the risk of unauthorized discount activations and enrollment at multiple residences.\n\n \n\n[1] The City imposes utility user taxes as a general tax on the consumption of electricity, gas, and communication services. While administered by the Office of Finance, utility user taxes are collected and remitted to the City by the utilities, and deposited into the City’s General Fund. The City does not maintain data on exempted gas and communication user taxes, which could amount to several million dollars per year.\n\n[2] LADWP developed queries and extracted data from its billing system for purposes of this review. The data was not tested for reliability, but LADWP was provided an opportunity to review the analysis.\n\n[3] LADWP retained a consultant in June 2011 and estimated that its penetration rate was approximately 56 percent of eligible low-income households.\n\n[4] For example, LADWP recently surveyed attendees of three community events and the Office of Public Accountability routinely fields questions/concerns about the City’s discount programs.\n\n[5] The study reviewed LIHEAP discounts in Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia.\n\n[6] LADWP program managers stated that they perform recertification of LIDP customers on a three-year cycle. This process consists of sending reminder letters to program participants at specific intervals and requested that they provide proof of continued eligibility.\n\n[7] For example, the Bureau of Sanitation requested $790,000 during the FY 2015 budget cycle but was not successful.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City provides residents with a range of utility services including water, electricity, sewer, and trash removal. Private entities, such as Southern California Gas and various telephone companies, also provide residents with important services. Maintaining access to these services is essential to meeting residents’ basic needs and preserving their quality of life – regardless of socioeconomic status. Paying utility bills can be a significant burden for some of our most vulnerable residents, including older adults with fixed incomes, people with serious medical conditions, and hardworking families struggling to make ends meet.\n\nTo alleviate the financial burden of utility costs and protect vulnerable residents, the City provides discount programs that are designed to keep costs affordable for qualified households and assist those experiencing an unexpected crisis, such as a medical emergency.[8] While the City’s programs have been in place for decades, it is important to ensure that these programs are helping qualified residents.\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) oversees investor-owned utilities (IOUs) throughout the State and establishes uniform guidance for low-income discount programs. IOUs in California regularly collect and report performance data that provides the public and policymakers with insight into how the discount programs are impacting low-income customers. The table below provides a partial snapshot of utility discount program data reported to the CPUC by the State’s three-largest IOUs in 2018.[9]\n\nPublicly-owned utilities – such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) – are subject to local control and oversight. This local authority provides an opportunity to design and administer customer discount programs to meet the needs of vulnerable Angelenos.\n\nTHE CITY’S UTILITY DISCOUNT PROGRAMS\n\nThe City’s two primary customer assistance programs – the Low-Income Discount Program (LIDP) and Lifeline – provide participants with ongoing or short-term financial assistance in the form of discounted service fees or exemptions from local utility user taxes.[10] These programs are primarily administered by LADWP; discounts and tax exemptions are applied through the department’s billing system. Entities such as the City’s Office of Finance, Bureau of Sanitation, and private utilities collaborate with LADWP to carry out tasks such as:\n\nIdentifying potential participants;\nReviewing customer applications to verify eligibility;\nActivating discounts and exemptions for eligible customers;\nBilling customers for services;\nPeriodically recertifying participating customers for continued eligibility; and\nDeactivating discounts for customers who are no longer eligible.\n\nDuring the last three fiscal years (FY 2017 to FY 2019), an average of 278,600 households (21 percent of residential accounts) participated in either program and received an average of $72 million in assistance per year.\n\nLow Income Discount Program\n\nThe Low Income Discount Program (LIDP) provides assistance for power, water and bulky item pickup. LIDP does not provide exemptions to utility user taxes. The eligibility threshold for participation in LIDP is dependent on the overall household size. The maximum gross income for a family of two cannot exceed $33,820, but the threshold increases by $8,840 for each additional household member.[11]\n\nTo participate, residential customers must submit an application and provide proof of income for all household members. Because LIDP does not provide exemptions from utility user taxes, LADWP – rather than the Office of Finance – is responsible for performing important administrative activities related to eligibility screening and discount activation.\n\nDuring the last three fiscal years, LIDP had 179,600 annual participants who received $30 million in utility discounts – an average of approximately $14 per month. To better understand the overall impact of this financial assistance, we calculated data provided by LADWP and found that LIDP participants received approximately 18 percent in discounts on their monthly bills.\n\nLifeline Discount Program\n\nThe City’s Lifeline Discount Program provides discounted fees on several utility services provided by the City and exemption from utility user taxes.[12] Residential customers who are disabled or at least 62 years of age and have an adjusted gross household income of less than $41,800 are eligible to participate in Lifeline.[13]\n\nUnlike LIDP, Lifeline does not use a tiered scale to account for multiple household members. This leaves out residents in larger households that slightly exceed the income eligibility threshold, and are likely to incur higher bills due to additional demand for utility services. For example, a disabled adult and three additional family members with a combined annual income of $50,000 are not eligible for assistance through Lifeline.\n\nTo participate in Lifeline, residents must submit an application and supporting documentation that shows proof of age/disability and income. Applicants must specify the utility services for which they are seeking discounts. Because Lifeline includes exemptions from various utility user taxes, the Los Angeles Municipal Code assigns responsibility to the Office of Finance – the City’s tax administrator and collector – with reviewing and approving Lifeline applications. If approved, Finance instructs utilities (e.g., LADWP, Sanitation, SoCalGas, telephone service providers) to activate discounts and discontinue collection of applicable utility user taxes.\n\nDuring the last three fiscal years, Lifeline had an average of 99,100 participants who received $43 million in discounts and utility user tax exemptions at some point during the year – an average of approximately $36 per month. To better understand the overall impact of this financial assistance, we calculated data provided by LADWP and found that Lifeline participants received approximately 31 percent in discounts and tax exemptions during the last three fiscal years.\n\nMAXIMIZING THE IMPACT OF THE CITY’S UTILITY DISCOUNT PROGRAMS\n\nGiven the number of Angelenos living in economically insecure households, the City needs to ensure that each dollar spent on its utility discount programs is helping residents most in need of assistance. In addition, the City needs to determine whether there are opportunities to have a deeper impact on affordability for residents who need help. This report is intended to provide City Policymakers and program administrators with a roadmap to improving LIDP and Lifeline.\n\n \n\n[8] The federal government also provides assistance with utility bills and home weatherization through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The program is overseen by the California Department of Community Services and Development and administered at the local level by grant-funded recipient agencies. According to LADWP, approximately 18,000 of its accounts received almost $8 million in LIHEAP assistance for electricity service in FY 2018.\n\n[9] Penetration rate typically measures the number of low-income customers enrolled in a discount program to the overall number of eligible customers within a utility’s service territory.\n\n[10] Utility user taxes are imposed by the City on the consumption of electricity, gas, and communication services.\n\n[11] The eligibility threshold is based on CPUC’s uniform guidance for low-income programs, which was within 200 percent of the federal poverty level as of June 2019.\n\n[12] The extra capacity charge/discount only applies if a customer has requested solid waste disposal capacity that exceeds normal service levels.\n\n[13] The adjusted gross income threshold is based on the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) definition of “very low income” for a family of two in Los Angeles County. The\nLifeline Program defines disabled as “…if he or she is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment…”\n\nIMPROVING OUTREACH AND PROGRAM IMPACT\n\nDiscounts offered through LIDP and Lifeline can make a difference – the City needs to do everything possible to engage potential participants and make informed decisions about how to improve program performance. LADWP has taken steps in recent years to assess program data and improve accessibility.\n\nThe Equity Metrics Data Initiative (2016) seeks to provide a data-driven framework that assesses how well LADWP’s programs, services, and resources are distributed and used throughout the city, both geographically and demographically, to see whether any disparities exist. This framework includes high-level information about Lifeline and LIDP, such as the number of participants and heat maps showing participation in low-income Census tracts.\nThe Low-income Customer Access program (LICA) was established in 2017 to improve customer access to discount and assistance programs that will help reduce their energy burden, improve customer experience, and build trust and support. Beyond engaging potential participants, the program is intended to improve the intradepartmental coordination of low-income customer assistance programs. LICA consists of one full-time professional who reports to the department’s Chief Customer Care Officer.\n\nDespite these efforts, we found that the City can do much more to help residents experiencing financial hardship. Improvements will require a collaborative effort across multiple City departments and external stakeholders.\n\nPROACTIVE AND TARGETED OUTREACH\n\nLADWP’s current outreach model consists of notifying potential program participants using mostly indirect, conventional methods such as:\n\ndistribution of brochures and mailing inserts on a non-recurring basis;\nlinks on some departmental websites;\nassistance at customer service locations or via telephone;\npartnerships with community-based organizations; and\nattendance at selected community events.\n\nThese approaches are time-tested and represent the foundation of a comprehensive customer engagement strategy. However, LADWP should implement a more proactive and targeted approach by leveraging existing customer data from its billing system.\n\nFor instance, the utility could proactively reach out to customers experiencing repeated financial challenges (e.g., multiple shutoff notices within a year) but are not enrolled in the program. Another approach would be to target households that go extended periods before billing issues are resolved and service is restored. City officials acknowledged the potential of these strategies but have not pursued them due to privacy concerns.\n\nAnother useful tool to reducing monthly utility bills are energy/water efficiency upgrades such as low flow showerheads and LED lighting. Lower income residents typically live in older – less energy efficient – homes and energy/water consumption is also affected by a greater number of people living in the household. While these customers may lack the resources to invest in costly building retrofits, there are a variety of different programs (some offered by LADWP) to help ease the cost burden. LADWP should use its billing data to identify households with high energy/water usage patterns and initiate contact to determine whether they are eligible for financial or weatherization assistance.\n\nBeyond using available data to initiate telephone calls with potential program participants, the City should provide information about its discount programs and energy efficiency upgrades in mailings or emails to customers who receive overdue bill notices or service disconnection warnings.\n\nMEASURING EFFECTIVENESS AND REPORTING RESULTS\n\nIn conjunction with making changes to how it engages potential program participants, the City needs to develop an evaluation framework that allows it to determine whether its efforts are successful. We found that the City is currently collecting high-level output data that primarily measures activity levels, not outcomes. Data tracked through LADWP’s Low-income Customer Assistance Program (LICA) include the following:\n\nmeetings with working groups;\nnumber of targeted outreach programs;\nsurveys conducted;\nnumber of new participants; and\nnumber of external partners who are advertising information about LADWP’s utility discount programs.\n\nIn contrast, IOUs report more insightful metrics to the CPUC that allow regulators and the public to better evaluate how well utilities are performing. The subsection below describes one specific metric – penetration rate – that can be used to assess the effectiveness of the City’s outreach activities.\n\nHowever, there are a host of other useful measures that can be used to measure the overall impact of the City’s efforts. For example, what percentage of customers enrolled in LIDP or Lifeline have accounts in arrears or are still receiving shutoff notices? What percentage of customers enrolled in LIDP or Lifeline have also signed up for energy efficiency upgrades offered by LADWP or other entities?\n\nThe City should establish formal data collection and reporting processes and embed them into a performance measurement framework that is used to establish goals, evaluate outcomes, and make informed decisions about how to improve Lifeline and LIDP.\n\nPenetration rate – Tracking the number of residents enrolled in a customer assistance program allows utilities to monitor enrollment trends and program expenses. However, that approach is not adequate because it does not provide context about the overall number of households that are potentially eligible for utility discounts.\n\nThis metric compares the estimated number of eligible low-income customers within a utility’s service territory to the number of customers enrolled in utility discount programs. CPUC has established a penetration goal of 90 percentfor investor-owned utilities.\n\nThe City does not actively manage its utility discount programs using a similar approach.[14] In order to develop a conservative estimate of the City’s current penetration rate, we compared the number of program participants reported by LADWP to Census data about the number of households that likely fall below the lowest income eligibility threshold ($33,800) for participation in LIDP or Lifeline.[15] While the analysis depends on the accuracy of household income data reported by the Census, it provides a general sense of the number of households that may qualify for assistance versus the number that are actually enrolled.\n\nThe City can also use qualitative information – collected through formal surveys and informal methods such as customer complaints/inquiries – to better manage its discount programs. Currently, this information is collected on a limited and ad hoc basis.[16]\n\nPRIORITIZING INCLUSION AND ACCESSIBILITY\n\nThe overall impact of any customer assistance program is closely tied to administrators’ ability to perform targeted outreach and connect eligible residents to services. Multipronged communication strategies are needed in order to engage diverse populations of customers, and the burden of applying for the program needs to be minimized to the greatest extent possible.\n\nConvenience – Beyond effectively communicating information about utility discounts, the City should make it easy for eligible residents to participate. Customers interested in LIDP can submit applications directly through LADWP’s website. In contrast, residents interested in enrolling in the Lifeline program must submit applications – including sensitive proof of age/income/disability documents – through the mail or in-person at City Hall location during business hours.\n\nMany potential participants may be uncomfortable sending confidential information through the mail, and others with jobs or mobility challenges will be less likely to travel to City Hall to submit applications. The Office of Finance is shifting to online Lifeline applications in the coming months.\n\nInformation for non-English speakers – English is a second language for many Angelenos, and there are often cultural factors that need to be considered when communicating information. Connecting these residents to government services is an important part of building an inclusive City.\n\nInformation about the City’s utility discount programs are available on LADWP’s website and printed materials in English and Spanish. While these represent the most commonly spoken languages in Los Angeles, residents whose primary language is Chinese, Tagalog, Korean, Armenian, Vietnamese, Persian, Japanese, or other commonly spoken languages may face challenges obtaining information. The City should determine which languages are most prevalent and modify their websites and printed materials to ensure that residents in diverse communities can easily decide whether to apply for assistance.\n\nAccessibility for residents with disabilities – Residents with disabilities are eligible for the Lifeline program if their household income falls below the established threshold. Given this target population, it is important for the City to communicate program information in a manner that is accessible for residents with vision, hearing, or other challenges. LADWP and the Office of Finance should partner with subject matter experts in the City’s Department on Disability to ensure that each of its outreach strategies fully considers the needs of these residents.\n\nCross-promotion of program information – One of the easiest ways for the City to disseminate information about its discount programs is to facilitate collaboration with departments (e.g., Aging, Disability, Housing and Community Investment) that frequently engage with similar target populations. Currently, these departments’ websites include information about customer assistance programs offered by non-City entities – but do not include Lifeline/LIDP information or links to LADWP’s website.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo address these issues, City Policymakers should:\n\nCreate a working group consisting of representatives from LADWP, Finance, and Sanitation to collaborate on improving outreach and evaluation activities related to the City’s utility discount programs, and instruct them to carry out the following tasks.\nUse billing data to proactively identify and contact customers who are likely to qualify for discounted utility bills. Provide these customers with information about LIDP/Lifeline and opportunities to lower bills through energy/water efficiency upgrades.\nDevelop an improved performance measurement framework that allows the City to evaluate whether its outreach efforts are successful and whether the programs are resulting in better outcomes for Angelenos in need of assistance.\nRefine the current outreach strategy to include information in additional languages, easy access for residents with disabilities or mobility challenges, and incorporate input from subject matter experts such as the Department of Aging, Department on Disability, and Office of Public Accountability.\nEstablish performance goals and require relevant departments to submit annual reports detailing their efforts and strategies for improvement.\n\n \n\n[14] LADWP retained a consultant in June 2011 and estimated that its penetration rate was approximately 56 percent of eligible low-income households.\n\n[15] The actual penetration rate is likely lower than 68 percent because this analysis does not account for: (1) households with three or more residents, which qualify for LIDP at higher income thresholds; (2) households which meet Lifeline’s age/disability criteria and have annual incomes up to $41,800; and (3) households that only received short-term financial assistance during FY 2018.\n\n[16] For example, LADWP surveyed attendees of three community events and the Office of Public Accountability routinely fields questions/concerns about the City’s discount programs.\n\nGUARDING AGAINST FRAUD AND PREVENTING WASTE\n\nThe City’s utility discount programs are need-based and are intended to help Angelenos who meet specific eligibility criteria. While some customer assistance programs offered by IOUs allow participants to self-certify their eligibility, participants in the City’s programs must submit proof of age/income/disability status in order to qualify. Financial assistance provided through Lifeline and LIDP requires careful stewardship; the City issued more than $70 million in discounts and tax exemptions annually over the last three fiscal years.\n\nFraud by recipients is an inherent risk in the administration of public assistance programs that provide financial benefits. In addition, lax supervision increases the likelihood that customers who are no longer eligible continue to receive discounts. As the City takes steps to boost its outreach activities, it is equally important to strengthen the integrity of LIDP and Lifeline. Preventing fraud and waste are especially important because every dollar that is issued to someone who no longer meets the eligibility threshold is a dollar that is not available to someone who does.\n\nA 2010 study by the U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) found that 9 percent of households that received LIHEAP discounts should not have received benefits.[17] During the course of this review, we identified several gaps in the City’s administration of its customer assistance programs – primarily Lifeline – that increase the likelihood that utility discounts are being provided to residents who no longer qualify.\n\nCustomers living at a service address can continue receiving discounts through Lifeline even though the original applicant who qualified for the program passed away several years ago.\nA loophole in screening processes for LIDP and Lifeline can allow customers to receive unauthorized water discounts.\nCustomers using their discount eligibility to enroll non-primary service addresses in Lifeline or LIDP.\n\nThe subsections below outline areas where the City can improve the administration of its customer assistance programs. The City should exercise caution while implementing these strategies in order to avoid inadvertently removing eligible customers.\n\nRECERTIFYING CUSTOMERS FOR CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY\n\nThe Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) tasks the City’s Office of Finance and Bureau of Sanitation with verifying continued eligibility for Lifeline participants every two years. Although this provision is limited to discounts for solid waste collection, recertification is an industry best practice, especially for publicly-owned utilities. LADWP program managers stated that they perform recertification of LIDP customers on a three-year cycle. This process consists of sending reminder letters to program participants at specific intervals and requested that they provide proof of continued eligibility.\n\nThe City’s current approach is to allow Lifeline participants to remain enrolled indefinitely, and there are no protocols in place to reestablish continued eligibility. The most recent recertification of Lifeline participants was performed in FY 2012. In addition, the last recertification process excluded nearly half of the customers registered in Lifeline. The Bureau of Sanitation requested $790,000 during the FY 2015 budget cycle but was not successful.\n\nIn order to qualify for Lifeline, customers must demonstrate that they meet the income threshold and are either disabled or over the age of 62. While these groups are less likely to experience life changes (e.g., obtaining new employment) that disqualify them for financial assistance, circumstances can change. For example, enrolled customers may pass away or begin receiving help from family members.\n\nAs a result of the City’s inaction, an unknown number of customer accounts are receiving financial assistance even though: (1) the customer no longer qualifies for assistance; or (2) they are deceased and discounts are being passed along to someone who has not been screened for eligibility.\n\nRecertifying Lifeline customers should be prioritized given the amount of discounts issued. On average, each Lifeline customer received twice the amount of discounts that LIDP customers received. In addition, Lifeline customers received approximately 59 percent of total discounts issued in the last three fiscal years ($128 million) while accounting for 35 percent of overall enrollment between both programs.\n\nBecause all three City departments (LADWP, Finance, and Sanitation) involved with administering Lifeline discounts cited the cost as the primary reason for discontinuing the recertification process, we sought to identify opportunities to lower administration costs.[18] The process of manually contacting hard-to-reach program participants to verify continued eligibility is likely unavoidable in order to effectively administer the program. However, the City should explore options to streamline the process by leveraging third-party data, using a risk-based approach, and improving coordination across departments.\n\nThird-party data – Federal entities such as the Social Security Administration (SSA) collect data used by financial and credit firms, as well as government agencies, to match records and prevent identity fraud. One specific dataset is the SSA Death Master File, which includes information on each decedent such as name, social security number, and date of birth. Periodically cross-referencing Lifeline participants to this information may be a low-cost approach to verify accounts that are no longer eligible for discounts.\n\nPhased approaches – Not all customers enrolled in Lifeline are the same. Some of these participants are on fixed-incomes that fall far below the qualifying threshold, while others have variable income that falls just below the required amount. These differences may help predict which enrollees are more likely to experience wage growth and no longer qualify for assistance. The City can leverage this type of data to make informed decisions about how to prioritize and allocate resources for recertification – while also ensuring that this approach does not raise any legal or equity concerns.\n\nInformation-sharing across City departments and private utilities – The City provides discounts and tax exemptions on several types of services through Lifeline, and the process includes coordination with over a dozen private utility companies. While this structure increases the likelihood of information gaps, it also provides opportunities to improve program administration and verification of continued eligibility. For example, the City did not notify private utilities of households that were identified as ineligible through the Lifeline recertification process in FY 2012. If the City shared the information, the private utilities (e.g., Verizon) could have resumed collecting utility user taxes from those customers and remitted them to the City – to ultimately be deposited into the General Fund.\n\nSECONDARY REVIEWS OF DISCOUNT ACTIVATIONS\n\nWhile the process of screening and recertifying customer applications should be further streamlined, the City needs to balance convenience with accuracy and program integrity. LADWP and Finance do not periodically test accounts enrolled in its customer assistance programs to determine whether the discounts/tax exemptions were activated in accordance with program requirements. Customer service representatives are authorized to activate discounts without a secondary or supervisory approval, which increases the likelihood that unauthorized benefits are being issued.\n\nFor example, 150 LADWP customer service representatives have access to the module in the billing system that activates discounts, but only 11 representatives are actually trained and authorized to review applications. While it may not be feasible or cost effective to test all enrolled accounts, a representative sample would likely provide additional assurance about program integrity.\n\nRESTRICTING UTILITY DISCOUNTS TO PRIMARY RESIDENCES\n\nAccording to LADWP and Finance, participants in Lifeline and LIDP are only eligible for discounts on their primary residence. However, the current screening procedures are not designed to identify applicants who are already enrolled at a different residential address. The lack of safeguards in this area increases the likelihood that customers take advantage of this loophole and activate utility discounts at multiple households.\n\nRecommendations\n\nTo address these issues, City Policymakers should:\n\nInstruct the working group (as outlined in Recommendation #1) to carry out the following tasks.\nIdentify sources of funding and recertify participants in the Lifeline program in order to identify customers who are no longer eligible to participate.\nStreamline and improve the recertification process by leveraging existing third-party data, use a risk-based framework to identify ineligible customers, and improve coordination across departments.\nStrengthen protocols to mitigate the risk of unauthorized discount activations and enrollment at multiple residences.\n\n \n\n[17] The study reviewed LIHEAP discounts in Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia.\n\n[18] Officials from Sanitation estimated that the FY 2012 recertification involved 93 employees working over 20,000 hours, at an estimated cost of $750,000. We were not able to substantiate these calculations and note that LADWP appears to perform LIDP recertification without a similar cost burden.\n\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\nNumber\tRecommendation\tResponsible Entity\n\nImproving Outreach and Program Impact\n\n\n1\n\t\nCreate a working group consisting of representatives from LADWP, Finance, and Sanitation to collaborate on improving outreach and evaluation activities related to the City’s utility discount programs, and instruct them to carry out the following tasks.\n\na.

Increasingly dangerous conditions brought about by climate change contribute to the intensity and frequency of these fires. Both natural and human factors can cause wildfire ignitions, such as lightning strikes, uncontrolled campfires, vehicle fires, or arson incidents. However, many of the State’s most destructive wildfires have been caused by overhead power lines.\n\nAccording to data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), ten of the twenty most destructive wildfires in State history have occurred since 2015. Of the ten wildfires, six were caused by overhead power lines. Tragically, these fires burned almost 649,000 acres, destroyed nearly 23,500 structures, and killed 108 people. The recent surge in catastrophic wildfires, and the human and financial toll that comes with them, has prompted agencies and power utilities to carefully examine how to reduce the likelihood that power lines will cause wildfires.\n\nAngelenos receive their electricity from the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). LADWP is the largest publicly-owned power utility in the United States, supplying electricity to more than 1.5 million customers in Los Angeles and the Owens Valley region. Now more than ever, LADWP needs to take action to protect communities, first responders, and wildlife habitats.\n\nLADWP’s overall exposure to wildfire risk is moderate, and the department faces several wildfire mitigation challenges.\nApproximately 15 percent of LADWP’s service territory falls within wildfire risk areas established by the California Public Utilities Commission’s (CPUC) High Fire Threat District mapping.\nApproximately 18 percent of LADWP’s high voltage transmission power lines, which extend far beyond the City’s boundaries, are in either CPUC High Fire Threat Districts or Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) Fire Hazard Zones. Approximately ten percent of transmission lines are located in CPUC Tier 3 (Extreme Risk) Threat Districts.\nAs of August 2019, LADWP data showed that there were 3,456 outstanding fire safety-related maintenance orders for distribution infrastructure in CPUC and LAFD fire risk areas. Nine of those orders were in CPUC Tier 3 (Extreme Risk) Districts. There were 996 pending maintenance orders in CPUC Tier 2 (Elevated Risk) Districts, and 2,451 pending in LAFD Fire Hazard Zones.\nThe largest maintenance backlog is 2,230 utility poles identified for replacement in LAFD zones. On average, LADWP replaces poles in LAFD fire zones at a rate of 63 per year. (Note: Several hours prior to the release of this report, LADWP contacted the Controller’s Office to report that the maintenance backlog in LAFD fire zones is actually 30 poles. LADWP did not provide verification for this change, and therefore, we could not confirm the veracity of these claims.)\nNearly 49,000 utility poles – most of which are wooden – fall within wildfire risk areas established by the CPUC and LAFD. Of those, nearly 30 percent are more than 65 years old, which is their typical useful life.\nLADWP does not have a program dedicated solely to wildfire planning and prevention, and it does not track incident data for ignitions caused by LADWP equipment.\nLADWP has taken some steps to mitigate wildfire dangers. However, additional actions are necessary.\nThe department has established enhanced design and construction standards for infrastructure located in wildfire risk areas.\nFrom FY 2016 through FY 2019, LADWP replaced an average of 1,945 distribution assets (poles, crossarms, and transformers) annually in CPUC and LAFD fire risk zones.\nThe department does not use what are known as automatic reclosers along its high voltage transmission lines. Automatic reclosers, which send bursts of electricity through a power line after there has been a disruption, can cause fires in wildfire-prone areas.\nLADWP is in the process of developing a comprehensive wildfire prevention plan which will outline current and planned wildfire risk reduction strategies.\nMoving forward, a combination of new technologies, aggressive inspection and maintenance activities, and strategic planning can help protect both the public and LADWP’s financial health.\nIn order to make it easier to streamline maintenance operations and identify infrastructure risks, LADWP should modernize its inventory management and maintenance systems, and explore applications for artificial intelligence tools.\nLADWP should enhance its power line inspection programs to include more frequent inspections in risky areas, and adopt new technologies that help inspectors identify fire safety threats.\nThe department should aggressively work to eliminate maintenance backlogs which currently exist in fire risk areas.\nThe department should work with other publicly-owned utilities in the State to consider the establishment of a joint wildfire insurance fund to help protect against wildfire related financial losses.\n\nLADWP must improve its ability to detect fire safety issues, address emerging maintenance backlogs, and modernize its approach to managing infrastructure so that it can become more proactive in its mitigation of wildfire risks. This report and its recommendations are intended to provide LADWP with a combination of strategies and solutions that should be pursued in order to protect Angelenos from the growing threat of wildfires.\n\nI. WILDFIRE RISK FOR LADWP\n\nLADWP owns and operates power line infrastructure that spans three states – California, Nevada, and Utah.[1] It consists of a large, complex network of high voltage transmission power lines (3,507 overhead miles) which carry electricity from power generation facilities into the region, and low voltage distribution power lines (7,148 overhead miles) which then deliver power to residents and businesses.\n\nWildfire risk related to LADWP equipment is generally lower in comparison to California’s large investor-owned utilities (IOUs) like Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas and Electric. LADWP’s risk profile is lower because its distribution network is primarily located in densely populated urban areas, and its transmission lines span mostly non-forested or arid landscapes where there is less vegetation to serve as a fuel source.\n\nHowever, LADWP’s overhead power lines located in areas designated as wildfire risk zones by the CPUC and LAFD are a concern.\n\nLADWP, given its lower wildfire risk exposure, has decided not to take some of the more drastic wildfire safety precautions adopted by IOUs. For example, LADWP stated it does not need to initiate proactive power shutoffs, where a utility will shut off power in fire prone areas during dangerous weather conditions, such as high winds.\n\nHowever, wildfire mitigation efforts by LADWP are necessary not only to promote public safety, but to protect the finances of the department. California’s utilities are liable for damages caused by their equipment, whether or not their management of the equipment was negligent. California’s application of a legal concept known as “inverse condemnation” can cause utilities like LADWP to face sizable liabilities in the event they cause a wildfire.\n\nWildfire damages involving power lines can be costly for a utility. The U.S. Forest Service determined that in 2013, equipment failure along an LADWP power line in the Angeles National Forest caused the Powerhouse Fire, which burned approximately 30,000 acres and destroyed 58 structures. For that fire alone, LADWP’s insurers (Aegis Security Insurance Company, Energy Insurance Mutual Limited, and AXA XL) paid approximately $100 million to settle claims against the department. LADWP did not admit liability.\n\nBoth the public safety and financial risks associated with wildfires highlight the need for LADWP to reduce the likelihood that its electrical assets contribute to the ignition of a wildfire.\n\nII. COVERING FINANCIAL LOSSES FOLLOWING WILDFIRES\n\nOverall, LADWP’s coverage for wildfire-related losses is approximately $360 million:\n\n$178 million in commercial excess liability coverage for wildfire losses; and\n$182 million set aside in its Power Revenue Fund for self-insurance.\n\nWhile this is an important step in protecting against financial liabilities, risk models generated by LADWP consultants estimated that the department can expect, on average, $42 million per year in wildfire-related losses over the next 100 years. The financial risks posed by utility-caused wildfires warrants additional action by LADWP in order to protect its financial health, and reduce the likelihood that liability costs will be passed on to customers.\n\nIn July 2019, the State passed a law establishing a wildfire insurance fund for IOUs. The fund will receive contributions from participating IOUs, and will pay future eligible costs in the event an IOU’s equipment causes a fire. Only IOUs are able to participate in this State wildfire fund. While the establishment of such a fund among publicly-owned utilities would pose unique challenges, the ability to share financial risks with other utilities could prove beneficial for LADWP and other participants.\n\nTo protect against future wildfire liabilities, LADWP should:\n\nIn conjunction with peer utilities within the State, formally assess the legal and financial feasibility of establishing a wildfire insurance fund for publicly-owned utilities.\nIII. LADWP’S INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES\n\nAmong the most important components of a utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts are its inspection and maintenance activities. Equipment failures can cause electrical arcing, which is when electricity is no longer contained by protective equipment. If this occurs near a receptive fuel source, it can cause an ignition. One of the safest ways to carry electricity is by burying power lines underground. However, burying power lines is not always feasible and can be cost prohibitive, as it can cost millions of dollars per mile. The prevalence of overhead power lines across LADWP’s power system highlights the need for the department to operate these assets as safely as possible.\n\nLADWP performs annual patrol inspections of distribution lines, which is a visual inspection to identify obvious safety issues, and conducts more thorough checks – known as “detail inspections” – every five years, where an inspector conducts a comprehensive evaluation of distribution equipment to identify maintenance issues. Transmission lines are evaluated by semiannual helicopter patrols, and periodic detail inspections. When inspectors identify a maintenance need, they log the issue in a maintenance management system. The department prioritizes pending work based on relevant safety and power reliability needs, and crews are then dispatched to make necessary repairs or replace failing equipment.\n\nLADWP must take aggressive action to address any identified maintenance needs in wildfire risk areas. The department’s distribution infrastructure, which generally represents a greater risk than its steel tower-based transmission assets, requires special attention. As of August 2019, LADWP data shows that the department has mostly kept pace with maintenance needs in the highest risk districts. However, the department should work quickly to eliminate maintenance backlogs which have emerged for certain types of assets. Specifically, there are:\n\n816 utility poles in CPUC Tier 2 (Elevated Risk) Districts which have been identified for replacement;\n2,230 utility poles in LAFD Fire Hazard Zones fire risk zones which have been identified for replacement (Several hours prior to the release of this report, LADWP contacted the Controller’s Office to report that the maintenance backlog in LAFD fire zones is actually 30 poles. LADWP did not provide verification for this change, and therefore, we could not confirm the veracity of these claims.); and\n50 transformers in LAFD Fire Hazard Zones which have been identified for replacement.\n\nLADWP should also improve its ability to detect safety issues in wildfire risk areas before they trigger an incident, especially as it relates to the department’s higher risk distribution assets. Enhanced inspection activities could include increasing the frequency of inspections, deploying drones to help inspectors find hard-to-spot problems, and increasing the use of infrared cameras to identify hot spots that may indicate equipment failure.\n\nVegetation (i.e., trees, vines, and brush) contact with energized utility equipment is another major fire risk. LADWP’s vegetation management program works to prevent fire dangers by eliminating vegetation and debris that may interfere with power equipment. Crews complete annual patrols along power lines, and trimmed nearly 190,000 trees near transmission and distribution lines in FY 2019.\n\nGiven the importance of LADWP’s vegetation management function, the department should enhance the way it evaluates risks, and modernize its processes for tracking vegetation management operations. Other utilities have reported success following the implementation of new tree inventory management tools which help to track the work of vegetation crews, and identify vegetation trends impacting wildfire safety. Some utilities have partnered with local fire agencies to help vegetation crews identify, and learn about, fire safety risks.\n\nTo improve its ability to identify infrastructure and vegetation risks, the department should:\n\nEnhance its maintenance inspections in high fire threat zones. Enhancements could include, but should not be limited to: (1) inspection intervals of less than five years for detail inspections; (2) use of drone technology to improve inspectors’ ability to evaluate equipment on top of utility poles; and (3) inspection intervals of less than four years for hot spot-detecting infrared inspections.\nWork aggressively to eliminate maintenance backlogs so that those backlogs do not compound, and ensure the department can continue to manage workloads in high risk areas.\nEstablish a joint risk assessment and inspection initiative with LAFD to supplement LADWP’s evaluation of vegetation and other risk factors within high fire threat zones.\n\nThe department can also leverage new technologies which enable enhanced inspection and maintenance management capabilities, and should:\n\nExpand its use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology, or other spatial analysis technologies, to supplement vegetation management patrols of power lines and improve the department’s ability to evaluate vegetation risks in high fire threat zones.\nEvaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing a GIS-based inventory and workflow management system for its vegetation management program in order to improve efficiency, and improve the department’s ability to detect and analyze vegetation risks.\nIV. STRATEGIC PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS\n\nAlthough LADWP has taken some preliminary steps to reduce wildfire risks, there are opportunities to improve how the department evaluates wildfire risks. For example, the department does not have any staff dedicated to wildfire prevention efforts, and the department does not track instances where its equipment sparks an ignition. Having both ignition data and staff who can evaluate wildfire safety issues across the organization is essential for LADWP to fully understand its fire risks.\n\nBeyond staffing and data improvements, there are technology-driven solutions that can help LADWP make better operational and infrastructure planning decisions. A modern enterprise asset management system would help LADWP identify infrastructure risks. These systems help managers track the condition of assets, collect maintenance and failure data, and analyze infrastructure trends. There are also emerging technologies which leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze large amounts of real time utility data in order to detect anomalies that indicate potential equipment failures.\n\nTo improve its understanding of current and future wildfire risks, the department should:\n\nIntegrate dedicated wildfire prevention and safety staff to support ongoing wildfire risk assessment and planning activities, such as the identification of emerging hardware risks, and analysis of whether power lines should be undergrounded in the highest fire risk areas.\nOn a regular basis, provide the Board of Water and Power Commissioners and the City Council with a detailed record of fire incidents involving LADWP equipment.\n\nAdopting new technologies would enable improved infrastructure management and monitoring capabilities. The department should:\n\nDeploy remote monitoring tools in high fire risk areas, such as high definition cameras and weather stations, in order to improve situational awareness and the ability to respond to fire incidents.\nEvaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing an integrated enterprise asset management system for power assets.\nEvaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing advanced predictive analytics and artificial intelligence programs capable of helping the department detect and mitigate wildfire safety and asset reliability issues.\n\nTo ensure it has sufficient resources to make necessary wildfire mitigation investments, the department should:\n\nIn its next Power System Rate Proposal, specifically incorporate costs associated with wildfire safety initiatives to ensure the department has sufficient resources to make necessary infrastructure and information systems upgrades.\nCONCLUSION\n\nWith catastrophic wildfires becoming the new normal in California, it is critical that LADWP improve its ability to detect and address wildfire safety concerns, and make smart infrastructure management investments which improve the safety and reliability of the power system for years to come. Prioritizing improvements in these areas will allow LADWP to better protect ratepayers and property – and most importantly – promote public safety.\n\n \n\n[1] LADWP also has an ownership stake in transmission infrastructure in Oregon and Arizona, but is not responsible for its operation and maintenance.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCatastrophic wildfires are on the rise in California. These fires are dangerous, destructive, and can permanently alter the cities and communities they pass through. While wildfires in the State are not an entirely new phenomenon, the size and frequency of wildfires is a growing concern for residents, businesses, and public agencies.\n\nSeveral factors are increasing the intensity and frequency of fires. Climate change is making California more susceptible to fire risks. Extreme heat events are creating dangerous fire conditions. Dry seasons are longer and more intense, which stresses vegetation, and droughts and invasive pests like bark beetles are weakening and killing trees statewide.\n\nWith dangerous fire conditions becoming the new normal in California, the need to address fire risks associated with power lines and other equipment is becoming increasingly urgent. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) data shows that of the 20 most destructive wildfires on record, ten have occurred since 2015.[2] Of those ten fires, six were determined to have been caused by power lines, highlighting the growing risks posed by utility equipment. The destruction caused by those utility-caused wildfires was substantial.\n\nImpact of Catastrophic Wildfires Caused By California Utilities (2015 to Present)\n\n\n\n648,626\n\nAcres Burned\n\n\t\n23,472\n\nStructures Destroyed\n\n\t\n108\n\nPeople Killed\n\nMost California residents are served by three large investor-owned utilities (IOUs) – Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). Each of these utilities have been responsible for major wildfires.\n\nWitch Creek-Guejito Fires\n\nIn 2007, two fires in San Diego County, the Witch Creek Fire and Guejito Fire, merged during a Santa Ana wind event, causing the largest evacuation in the county’s history. The Witch Creek-Guejito Fires burned 198,000 acres, destroyed 1,141 residences, and killed two people.[3] In both fires, electrical arcing, which is a discharge of electricity from a piece of power equipment, caused by SDG&E power lines served as an ignition source. The Witch Fire was caused by SDG&E power lines slapping together, while the Guejito Fire was caused by SDG&E power lines coming into contact with an adjacent cable communications wire.\n\nThomas Fire\n\nIn December 2017, the Thomas Fire moved across Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, burning for nearly 40 days. The fire burned 281,900 acres, destroyed 1,063 structures, and resulted in the death of one firefighter and one civilian..[4] The Thomas Fire was caused when a high wind event caused SCE power lines to slap together and arc, which deposited molten material onto the vegetation below.\n\nCamp Fire\n\nThe November 2018 Camp fire in Butte County was the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in State history. The fire burned 153,300 acres, destroyed 18,804 structures, and resulted in 85 fatalities.[5] Several firefighters were also injured while trying to contain the fire. The fire was caused when a piece of equipment failed on a power line owned by PG&E. Investigators determined that strong winds, along with low humidity and high temperatures, caused the fire to spread quickly.\n\nWoolsey Fire\n\nIn November 2018, the Woolsey Fire, which started near the Santa Susana Field Laboratory between the borders of Simi Valley and Los Angeles, spread across Los Angeles and Ventura Counties for more than 50 days. The fire burned nearly 97,000 acres, destroyed 1,500 structures, and resulted in three fatalities.[6] While the cause of this fire is still under investigation, the State of California is investigating whether SCE equipment ignited the fire. The utility has acknowledged that just minutes before the fire started, there was an outage incident recorded within the vicinity of the ignition.\n\nLike other large utilities operating within the State, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the City’s publicly-owned utility, owns and operates a large and complicated network of power assets. While the department has not caused a catastrophic fire similar in scale to the Camp or Woolsey fires, which were two of the most destructive wildfires in the State’s history, recent incidents highlight the growing risk.\n\nPowerhouse Fire\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service determined that in 2013, equipment failure along an LADWP power line in the Angeles National Forest caused the Powerhouse Fire. The wildfire burned approximately 30,000 acres and destroyed 58 structures over 10 days.[7] LADWP reported that neither the age of the equipment nor improper maintenance contributed to the wildfire’s ignition. Instead, a piece of faulty equipment on a power pole known as an insulator, caused electrical arcing which sparked the incident.\n\nLADWP’s insurers settled Powerhouse Fire claims for approximately $100 million. The department paid a deductible of $3 million, of which $1 million was passed on to the manufacturer of the defective equipment. Although a settlement was determined to be the best course of action, LADWP admitted no liability for the fire and denied the sufficiency of all claims related to the fire.\n\nLADWP is also involved in litigation related to the 2017 Creek Fire, which burned approximately 16,000 acres in the Angeles National Forest and in Los Angeles County.[8] Plaintiffs allege that LADWP power lines caused the blaze. However, authorities have not determined the cause of the fire. LADWP’s internal investigation determined that its assets were not the cause.\n\nPower equipment represents a constant fire threat to California communities. The lack of affordable housing near job centers has pushed growing numbers of residents to wildland-urban interface areas, where housing and commercial development is adjacent to undeveloped, densely vegetated landscapes. In the City of Los Angeles alone, an estimated 630,000 people live in areas determined by CAL FIRE to be wildfire hazard zones. There are an estimated 114,000 buildings in the hazard zones as well, and the total estimated value of those structures and their contents is $73 billion.[9]\n\nWhile not all utility fire incidents become wildfires, data from the State shows just how often power equipment causes ignitions. From 2014 through 2018, California’s three largest IOUs (PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E) caused 2,583 ignition incidents where the fire traveled greater than one linear meter from ignition point.[10] Common causes for ignitions go beyond downed power lines, including:\n\nEquipment contact with an interfering object, such as vegetation, balloons, animals, and vehicles;\nEquipment failure;\nIndividuals vandalizing or stealing equipment; and\nPower lines slapping together, or into a third party’s equipment.\n\nThe most important risk related to wildfires is the threat to public safety and first responders. However, California utilities also face major financial risks in the event they contribute to a wildfire. California’s application of a legal concept known as “inverse condemnation” makes utilities fully liable for wildfire costs, regardless of whether they acted responsibly in relation to the incident. In other words, if power equipment is determined to be the cause, the utility can be held fully responsible for the costs, even if there is no determination the utility was negligent. Alabama is the only other state that applies inverse condemnation with the same level of strict liability.[11]\n\nA catastrophic wildfire can cost a utility billions of dollars. PG&E was forced to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2019 following a series of wildfires it caused in 2017 and 2018 in Northern California. PG&E has reported that the aggregate liability for claims in relation to the 2017 and 2018 fires was $17.9 billion.[12] The company believes the total liability related to those fires could exceed $30 billion.[13]\n\nLos Angeles Department of Water and Power\n\nLos Angeles residents and businesses receive their power from LADWP, the City’s publicly-owned municipal utility. LADWP is the largest publicly-owned electric utility in the United States. It supplies electricity to more than 1.5 million customers, including approximately 5,000 customers in the Owens Valley in eastern California.\n\nThe regulatory environment for utilities is complex. LADWP differs from IOUs like SCE because it is owned by the City and primarily subject to the oversight of the LADWP Board of Water and Power Commissioners, City Council, and Mayor. IOUs are private companies owned by shareholders, and are regulated in the State by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). Though the CPUC is not LADWP’s chief regulator, the department is subject to utility operating standards established by the agency, known as General Orders.\n\nIn addition to State regulatory bodies, both IOUs and publicly-owned utilities like LADWP are subject to oversight from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). FERC is an independent agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, natural gas, and oil, while NERC is a nonprofit corporation which establishes reliability standards for bulk power transmission.\n\nPower utilities across the State are aggressively upgrading infrastructure and revising operations in an effort to adapt to an environment where fire risks are a constant threat. It is important that LADWP does the same. Given the catastrophic wildfires seen across the state in recent years, and LADWP’s own involvement in the Powerhouse Fire, LADWP must ensure it mitigates – to the greatest extent possible – the wildfire risks posed by its infrastructure and operations.\n\n \n\n[2] “Top 20 Most Destructive California Wildfires.” CAL FIRE. 2019.\n\n[3]“Major Fires in San Diego: 2007 Witch Creek-Guejito Fires.” City of San Diego Fire Department.\n\n[4] “Cal Fire Incident Report: Thomas Fire.” CAL FIRE. 2019.\n\n[5] “Cal Fire Incident Report: Camp Fire.” CAL FIRE. 2019.\n\n[6] “Cal Fire Incident Report: Woolsey Fire.” CAL FIRE. 2019.\n\n[7] United States Forest Service Report of Instigation: Powerhouse Fire-Angeles National Forest. 2014\n\n[8] “Cal Fire Incident Report: Camp Fire.” CAL FIRE. 2018.\n\n[9] “City of Los Angeles 2018 Local Hazard Mitigation Plan.” City of Los Angeles Emergency Management Department. 2018.\n\n[10] Based on analysis of the CPUC Safety Enforcement Division’s 2014-2018 fire incident data for PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E\n\n[11] Kousky, C., Greig, K., Lingle, B., & Kunreuther, H.

LADWP is protected against future claims in the event it causes a major wildfire, but only to a certain extent. The department carries a commercial excess liability insurance policy which covers $178 million for wildfire losses, with a $3 million deductible. The annual premium is approximately $31.5 million. In addition to the insurance coverage, approximately $182 million from LADWP’s Power Revenue Fund is set aside for self-insurance, which can be used in the event of a catastrophic incident. This puts total coverage in the event of a wildfire at approximately $360 million.\n\nEarlier this year, LADWP hired an independent consultant to complete a wildfire property liability risk model to predict potential future losses. The consultant estimated LADWP can expect annual losses of $42 million over the next 100 years.\n\nIt is important to note that this is only a predictive insurance model, and that annual average losses could be less than, or exceed the estimated $42 million. Claims associated with the 2013 Powerhouse Fire, which destroyed 58 structures, cost the department’s insurers approximately $100 million. In any case, a single wildfire, or a series of wildfires over a short period of time, causing losses in excess of $360 million could significantly impact the department. The costs associated with a catastrophic wildfire would eventually be passed on to LADWP customers.\n\nAn Alternative Insurance Model\n\nThe State has recognized the difficult operating and legal environments for power utilities serving California residents. In July 2019, the Governor approved Assembly Bill 1054 which established a series of wildfire prevention and planning regulations and created a utility wildfire fund to pay eligible costs arising from a wildfire. Continuous contributions to the fund will be made by the participating IOUs, and through a ratepayer fee collected by the utilities. In order to tap into the wildfire fund to cover the costs of a catastrophic wildfire, a utility must demonstrate that it acted reasonably in caring for the equipment during the period leading up to the ignition.\n\nWhile the new wildfire fund will help IOUs mitigate the impact of wildfire costs resulting from the State’s inverse condemnation framework, the legislation establishing the fund allows for participation by IOUs only. There is currently no similar wildfire fund for publicly-owned utilities in the State, even though such a fund could benefit LADWP and other municipal utilities as they seek to reduce wildfire liabilities.\n\nThe establishment of a wildfire fund for publicly-owned utilities would pose unique challenges, as each utility has its own governance models and ratepayer rules, and unlike IOUs in the State, there is no single regulator for publicly-owned utilities. Despite the complexities associated with establishing such a fund, LADWP should examine whether a joint wildfire fund among publicly-owned utilities would be a prudent step to protect against growing liability risks.\n\nRecommendation\n\n1. LADWP should, in conjunction with peer utilities within the State, formally assess the legal and financial feasibility of establishing a wildfire insurance fund for publicly-owned utilities.\n\nDWP’S INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES\n\nLADWP conducts regular inspections of its distribution and transmission infrastructure. The results of these inspections inform department managers of system reliability risks – including fire safety risks – and allow managers and crews to plan and carry out maintenance activities.\n\nDistribution System Inspections and Maintenance\n\nLADWP conducts several types of overhead distribution system inspections with varying levels of detail and frequency. A description of distribution inspection activities is listed below. Our review did not include an assessment of the department’s compliance with policies and scheduling requirements for distribution equipment inspections.\n\nPatrol Inspections – LADWP performs annual patrol inspections along distribution lines. Patrol inspections are visual, non-invasive inspections where staff identify obvious safety and maintenance issues. In designated wildfire risk areas, patrols usually take place between March and April, which helps the department to identify and address concerns for the upcoming fire season.\n\nDetail Inspections – These inspections take place every five years and are full evaluations of distribution facility equipment, where staff assess the conditions of poles, conductor lines, transformers, fuses, insulators, and other assets. Crews can also make on-the-spot repairs for certain issues identified during the inspection process.\n\nPole Inspections – LADWP conducts pole inspections which evaluate the condition and integrity of the distribution system’s utility poles. For wood poles, inspection staff probe the utility pole to test for signs of decay or other factors which indicate the pole requires maintenance, reinforcement, or replacement. These inspections occur 20 years after initial installation, and then once every ten years thereafter.\n\nInfrared Inspections – The department supplements its distribution system evaluations with periodic infrared inspections. These inspections consist of LADWP staff using heat sensing infrared cameras to detect “hot spots” which cannot be seen by the human eye. Hot spots can indicate potential failure points exist, such as bad connections or failing components. Teams complete infrared inspections of the distribution system on a four-year cycle.\n\nMaintenance issues identified during inspection activities are logged and prioritized within the department’s Work Management Information System. The department prioritizes repairs based on the type of reliability or safety risk identified, and whether the needed repairs are in a designated wildfire risk area.\n\nPer the requirements of the CPUC General Order No. 95 (Rules for Overhead Electric Line Construction) LADWP policy is to immediately repair equipment which constitutes an imminent threat to public safety. Other maintenance needs which represent a moderate public safety risk must be repaired within six or twelve months, depending on the type of fire threat district the equipment is located in.\n\nLADWP data shows that, as of August 2019, there were 3,456 outstanding maintenance orders in designated high fire risk areas for issues that constitute fire safety risks. There were an additional 1,018 maintenance orders for repair needs that are not considered fire safety risks, such as issues related to underground equipment.\n\nMaintenance work order information in the following chart shows the number of assets in need of replacement as of August 2019, within designated high fire risk areas. It also shows equipment replacement figures in those high fire risk areas for FY 2016 through FY 2019.\n\nSeveral hours prior to the release of this report, LADWP contacted the Controller’s Office to report that the maintenance backlog in LAFD fire zones is actually 30 poles. LADWP did not provide verification for this change, and therefore, we could not confirm the veracity of these claims.\n\nLADWP’s maintenance data indicates it has been able to address equipment fire risks in the highest CPUC Tier 3 (Extreme Risk) Threat Districts, and most of the fire risks in CPUC Tier 2 (Elevated Risk) Threat Districts. However, maintenance backlogs for utility poles in Tier 2 and LAFD fire risk areas, and for transformers in LAFD fire risk areas, can increase the likelihood of LADWP equipment contributing to a fire ignition. Addressing current maintenance lags is critically important, as these issues can compound as the infrastructure ages and become more difficult to address in the future.\n\nStrengthening Distribution Inspection and Maintenance Activities\n\nEnhancements to LADWP’s distribution inspection activities would improve the department’s ability to detect fire risks in designated high fire risk areas. Opportunities include increasing the frequency of inspections in high risk areas, and using drones to supplement existing inspection work.\n\nShorter Intervals for Detail Inspections\n\nWhile LADWP’s procedures for detail inspections are consistent with CPUC rules governing inspections, the department could benefit from more frequent evaluations of assets in wildfire risk areas. Reducing the detail inspection cycle to shorter than the current five years would improve situational awareness, and allow more opportunities for crews to identify safety issues.\n\nSDG&E has implemented a “Quality Assurance/Quality Control Inspections” program for assets in CPUC Tier 3 (Extreme Risk) Threat Districts. The enhanced inspections exceed the requirements of the CPUC’s General Order for inspections, and place a special emphasis on fire safety and ignition risks. SDG&E conducts its quality control inspections for CPUC Tier 3 (Extreme Risk) Threat Districts on a three-year cycle.[18]\n\nShorter Intervals for Infrared Inspections\n\nInspections of power infrastructure using infrared technology has been a valuable method for detecting failure and safety risks not easily identifiable through visual inspections. Though current LADWP inspection practices for distribution assets call for infrared inspections on a four-year cycle, the department could benefit from using this inspection technology with greater frequency in high fire risk areas.\n\nFor example, SCE in 2017 began conducting biennial infrared inspections of overhead distribution equipment in high fire risk areas.[19] The images above show the value of infrared technology for inspection activity. The infrared image on the right detects a hot spot which is not visible with a standard image.\n\nUsing Drones to Improve Inspection Capabilities\n\nPublic utilities are increasingly using unmanned aerial vehicles, better known as drones, to augment inspection activities because they can provide crews and specialists with helpful images of the top of a utility pole. The use of drones can improve the ability to identify anomalies which indicate a fire safety risk, and can increase employee safety because the evaluations can take place without individuals having to climb the utility pole for closer inspection.\n\nUsing drones to supplement inspection and other risk assessment activities can improve the ability of LADWP to identify high threat assets in need of repair or replacement. It is important to note that the department would need to consider both Federal Aviation Administration restrictions on certain drone activities, and privacy issues associated with capturing images using drones. PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E are all developing drone programs in order to improve crews’ ability to evaluate equipment and terrain, especially in difficult-to-access locations.\n\nTransmission System Inspections and Maintenance\n\nLADWP monitors its transmission system through a series of aerial patrols, ground-based inspections, and detailed tower inspections. Maintenance needs identified during inspection activities are entered into the department’s Transmission Maintenance Database, which managers use to categorize and monitor maintenance work orders. A description of LADWP’s transmission inspection activities is listed below. This review did not include an assessment of the department’s compliance with policies and scheduling requirements for transmission line inspections.\n\nAerial Patrols – The department conducts regular helicopter-based aerial patrols of the transmission system to identify a wide range of safety, reliability, and security concerns. Aerial patrols occur semiannually – at least once during the first half of the year, and at least once in the second half of the year – with at least three months between intervals. During aerial patrols, staff assess the transmission towers themselves, conductor lines and their related hardware, and insulators. Aerial patrol crews also assess the right-of-way conditions along the transmission line corridors, taking into consideration vegetation or other external objects which may interfere with equipment.\n\nLine Patrols – LADWP inspectors conduct annual line patrols of transmission lines. During these patrols, inspectors use binoculars to conduct a visual inspection of towers, conductors, insulators, and other hardware. Similar to aerial patrols, staff also assess transmission corridor conditions to identify vegetation or other risks which may impact transmission towers or lines.\n\nClimbing Inspections – LADWP conducts detailed climbing inspections every one or ten years, depending on the location and type of tower. Inspectors complete annual climbing inspections of tower crossings that involve other transmission lines, freeways, major highways, railroads, and bodies of water. The remaining towers are inspected on a ten year cycle. During a climbing inspection, inspectors systematically evaluate tower conditions. Staff typically start at the tower’s base, and then progress up the tower and circle each section to assure 360 degree coverage. Special attention is given to critical bolts, arm supports, and conductor attachment points.\n\nInsulator Washing – In addition to this inspection and maintenance work, LADWP conducts scheduled insulator washing on transmission lines to reduce contamination build up, which can cause arcing and short circuits. Insulators are used to safely attach power lines to transmission towers and utility poles so that the electricity does not spread from the power line to the connected equipment. LADWP crews wash transmission line insulators at least once a year with de-mineralized water, though the department washes some insulators more frequently depending on the local conditions and insulator configurations.\n\nLADWP managers expressed a high degree of confidence in the reliability of the department’s transmission lines, citing strict design and construction standards, frequent inspections, and the level of external oversight for the department’s transmission infrastructure. In 2017, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council completed a transmission Operations and Planning Standards Audit, as required by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 693. Based on the evidence provided, WECC’s audit team, which evaluated LADWP compliance with 35 operations and planning regulations that are aimed at ensuring the security and reliability of the nation’s transmission system, found no violations. Examples of standards within the scope of the audit included:\n\nInspections and maintenance;\nMonitoring systems;\nControl center operations;\nTree trimming and vegetation management;\nEnergy emergencies and capacity;\nEmergency operations planning; and\nCommunications protocols.\n\nLADWP must remain vigilant as it inspects and maintains its transmission infrastructure, and aggressively work to address maintenance needs in high fire risk areas. Doing so is central to reducing fire risks in those areas, which is especially important due to the remote locations of transmission assets and the damage which could result from high-voltage power lines causing an ignition.\n\nVegetation Management\n\nLADWP’s vegetation management program is an important component of the department’s efforts to limit the risk of trees or other types of vegetation coming into contact with energized power lines. The policy of the vegetation management program is to conduct annual patrols of transmission and distribution lines to identify limbs and debris which are at risk of interfering with equipment, as vegetation contact can create electrical arcing and fire dangers, and can cause outages. The vegetation management program has established minimum required clearance distances between vegetation and power lines. Those distances vary depending on the type of power line, and are designed to comply with applicable federal and State standards.\n\nLADWP conducts its vegetation control activities with a combination of in-house and contract crews. The vegetation management program maintains a database to track the trees adjacent to power equipment and updates this database based on paper records and reports generated by field crews.\n\nIn FY 2019, the department trimmed a total of 189,921 trees along power lines and at LADWP facilities. Of those trees, 3,293 were located along the power system’s transmission lines. Crews also removed 3,274 high risk trees. The department does not separately track the number of trees trimmed and removed in high fire risk areas.\n\nStrengthening Vegetation Management Activities\n\nWhile trimming nearly 190,000 trees per year is an important step in reducing vegetation risks, there are opportunities to further improve the vegetation management function and reduce fire risks. Those opportunities include expanding its use of spatial analysis technology, implementation of a new tree asset management system, and leveraging the expertise of LAFD staff.\n\nLiDAR\n\nLight Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a remote sensing technology that uses a laser to analyze reflected light to create 3D images that accurately capture vegetation dimensions, and the proximity of vegetation to adjacent equipment. LiDAR is a powerful tool which could supplement the existing subject matter expertise of crews, and the vegetation patrol process. LiDAR is already used for certain transmission engineering projects. Expanding its use in high fire risk areas would help the department spot vegetation risks not easily identified through visual inspection.\n\nIntegrated Tree Asset Management\n\nA GIS-based tree inventory management system, with integrated work order management capabilities, can boost vegetation management efficiency and reduce fire risks. This type of system can help program managers track, analyze, and manage workflows, and would allow the vegetation management program to keep a comprehensive maintenance log for each inventoried tree. A secondary benefit is that these systems enable analytics which can identify vegetation trends, like which tree species have the highest growth rates, which trees have the highest rates of failure, and which regions are most susceptible to vegetation risks based on local factors.\n\nJoint Risk Assessments with LAFD Personnel\n\nLADWP is uniquely situated when compared to IOUs to leverage the expertise of other City departments. LADWP could benefit from conducting joint vegetation management inspections with LAFD personnel, where LAFD fire specialists can aid in identifying high risk conditions which present an ignition risk. SCE already partners with local fire departments within its service territory to conduct joint evaluations of vegetation risks.[20] According to SCE staff, the inspections not only improve the vegetation management process, but are an opportunity for firefighters and utility workers to cross train on utility management and fire safety issues.\n\nRecommendations\n\n2: In high fire threat areas, LADWP should work aggressively to eliminate maintenance backlogs so that those backlogs do not compound, and ensure the department can continue to manage workloads in high risk areas.\n\n3: LADWP should enhance its maintenance inspections in high fire threat zones. Enhancements could include, but should not be limited to, the following:\n\nInspection intervals of less than five years for detail inspection;\nThe use of drone technology to improve inspectors’ ability to evaluate equipment on top of utility poles; and\nInspection intervals of less than four years for hot spot-detecting infrared inspections.\n\n4: LADWP should establish a joint risk assessment and inspection initiative with LAFD to supplement LADWP’s evaluation of vegetation and other risk factors within high fire threat zones.\n\n5: In wildfire risk zones, LADWP should expand its use of LiDAR, or other spatial analysis technologies, to supplement vegetation management patrols of power lines and improve the department’s ability to evaluate vegetation risks.\n\n6: LADWP should evaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing a GIS-based inventory and workflow management system for its vegetation management program in order to improve efficiency, and improve the department’s ability to detect and analyze vegetation risks.\n\n[18] San Diego Gas and Electric Company Wildfire Mitigation Plan, February 2019.\n\n[19] Southern California Edison Company Wildfire Mitigation Plan, February 2019.\n\n[20] Southern California Edison Company Wildfire Mitigation Plan, February 2019.\n\nSTRATEGIC PLANNING AND INVESTMENTS\n\nStrategic changes to the department’s wildfire mitigation efforts, and broader infrastructure management changes, would boost the ability of the department to identify wildfire risk trends, and efficiently address those safety risks. These changes would improve not just reliability and operational efficiency with regard to wildfire risk areas, but would also support improved efficiency for the entire power system.\n\nCurrently the department does not have staff dedicated solely to wildfire prevention efforts, and the department does not track instances where its equipment sparks an ignition. Having both ignition data and staff who can evaluate wildfire safety issues across the organization is critically important if the department is to fully understand the wildfire safety risks across its power system. Opportunities also exist to leverage new asset management, analytics, and monitoring technologies to enhance the department’s ability to detect fire safety risks and trends.\n\nFormal Wildfire Mitigation Plan\n\nLADWP is in the process of developing its first ever comprehensive Wildfire Mitigation Plan. This plan was required by California Senate Bill (SB) 901, which was approved by the Governor in September 2018. Per the requirements of SB901, the plan must include several elements, including, but not limited to:\n\nDescriptions of the preventive strategies and programs to be adopted to minimize the risk of electrical lines and equipment causing catastrophic wildfires;\nMethodologies for identifying and presenting enterprise wide safety risks and wildfire risks;\nA comprehensive list that identifies, describes, and prioritizes all wildfire risks, and drivers for those risks, throughout the service territory;\nDescriptions of risks and risk drivers associated with design, construction, operation, and maintenance of equipment and facilities;\nPlans for inspections of electrical infrastructure;\nDescriptions of the metrics to be used to evaluate the wildfire mitigation plan’s performance and the assumptions that underlie the use of those metrics; and\nDescriptions of the processes and procedures to be implemented to monitor and audit the implementation of the mitigation plan, and to monitor and audit the effectiveness of electrical line and equipment inspections.\n\nThe Wildfire Mitigation Plan is due before January 1, 2020. Upon completion, LADWP’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan must be presented to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners for review. SB901 also requires the department to obtain validation from a qualified independent evaluator, who will review and certify the comprehensiveness of the plan. Subsequent legislation approved by the Governor in July 2019, Assembly Bill 1054, will allow utilities to develop a comprehensive mitigation plan once every three years, with annual updates between comprehensive plans.\n\nAccording to LADWP, the mitigation plan has been an opportunity to bring together subject matter experts and program managers from across the department in order to identify strengths and weaknesses related to fire safety issues. The mitigation plan should provide for improved wildfire safety planning, and increased accountability.\n\nA Dedicated Wildfire Safety Program\n\nWhile the development of its first comprehensive Wildfire Mitigation Plan is an important step in evaluating risks and strategies, LADWP does not have a dedicated wildfire mitigation and safety program which can provide technical wildfire expertise, and supplement existing infrastructure safety and reliability programs. Currently, an Electrical Services Manager, and a Transmission and Distribution District Superintendent within the department’s Power Transmission and Distribution Division are the lead authors and coordinators for LADWP’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan. While these individuals are highly qualified utility management experts, their primary responsibility is managing maintenance and engineering projects, whereas wildfire safety planning is a new, secondary responsibility.\n\nGiven the increasing risks and liabilities associated with utility-caused wildfires, the department would benefit from having a dedicated wildfire safety team. PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E have all developed programs dedicated to wildfire safety. These programs work with operational, emergency management, and planning groups within the utilities to help continually monitor infrastructure risks, environmental risks, and emerging wildfire safety trends.\n\nThe IOUs’ dedicated wildfire safety teams typically consist of cross-functional subject matter experts. For example, SDG&E has established both a Community Fire Safety Program to examine and improve the safety of its electrical system, and a Fire Science and Climate Adaptation Unit. SDG&E’s fire safety staff consists of meteorologists, fire coordinators, and community resiliency experts who work to improve the utility’s understanding of regional fire risks and the impact of climate change.[21]\n\nLADWP could improve its overall preparedness by having in-house expertise that can monitor wildfire risks, evaluate emerging wildfire safety technologies, and continuously analyze risks in order to help the department prioritize infrastructure investments. This group could help managers proactively identify and mitigate emerging hardware risks, and analyze the costs and benefits of undergrounding power lines in certain fire risk areas. The need for LADWP to analyze both the current wildfire risk environment, and emerging risks, will not end upon completion of the Wildfire Mitigation Plan.\n\nCollection and Analysis of Fire Incident Data\n\nLADWP does not specifically track fire incidents caused by its power equipment. As a result, the department lacks critical information which should be used to inform the development of wildfire safety plans and maintenance activities.\n\nCalifornia’s IOUs must consistently track incidents where their assets cause ignitions. In 2014, the CPUC adopted the Fire Incident Data Collection Plan, which required certain IOUs to collect and annually report fire incident information. The information allows for the identification of operational and environmental trends which are contributing to fire events. The utilities must report any self-propagating fire where resulting fire traveled greater than one linear meter from the ignition point.\n\nThe tracking of ignition incidents by LADWP would provide the department with crucial data and lessons which could be used to inform infrastructure and maintenance planning. Furthermore, the reporting of such information to appropriate oversight bodies within the City could improve transparency and accountability with regard to fire safety issues, as ignition data is a key risk indicator. Useful data for each incident would include:\n\nLocation;\nType of equipment involved;\nCause of the incident (equipment failure, foreign object contact, etc.);\nAge or estimated age of the equipment involved;\nFuel source;\nResponding fire agency (when applicable); and\nAmount of space burned.\nRemote Monitoring Tools\n\nAn important component of wildfire mitigation activities is the ability to monitor assets and conditions in real time, and adjust operations as necessary. Remote monitoring tools, if deployed by LADWP in wildfire risk areas, would improve situational awareness and the utility’s ability to monitor equipment and conditions in remote areas.\n\nOne tool which could improve the department’s situational awareness is the deployment of high-definition (HD) cameras. HD cameras can help utilities to quickly identify and triangulate fire incidents to allow for faster fire suppression response times. They can also help to ensure firefighting assets are deployed to areas where they can have the most impact.\n\nUtilities commonly deploy pan-tilt-zoom cameras, which give remote operators directional and zoom control. The State’s three IOUs have deployed, or are in the process of deploying, networks of HD cameras in high fire risk areas. SCE plans to achieve 90% visual coverage of its high fire risk areas by 2020 with the deployment of 160 cameras.[22]\n\nWeather stations are another tool that could support improved situational awareness. Utilities commonly use weather stations to identify high risk weather conditions which could impact power equipment, allowing the organization to adjust operations as necessary to reduce ignition risks. SDG&E owns and operates a network of over 175 weather stations affixed to distribution and transmission equipment.[23]\n\nEnterprise Asset Management Systems\n\nGiven the complexity and large scope of LADWP’s power infrastructure and operations, the department is forced to rely on multiple systems to track assets, inspections, maintenance, and inventories. However, a shift by LADWP toward the use of integrated enterprise asset management (EAM) systems to manage transmission and distribution assets could help the department manage wildfire risks moving forward, in addition to helping the department improve the overall reliability of its systems.\n\nMany infrastructure management agencies and utilities are adopting EAM models and systems. EAM systems typically include integrated inventory, maintenance management, business management, and analytics applications which improve an organization’s ability to manage infrastructure over the lifecycle of the asset.\n\nWhile the development and implementation of an EAM system would be a major undertaking, LADWP is already taking steps which lay the groundwork for such a program. LADWP is in the process of developing a comprehensive GIS-based inventory of its power lines, which will be an invaluable tool for the department. This inventory information, coupled with data about the age and specifications of the equipment, inspection histories, and maintenance data, would improve the department’s ability to:\n\nMake risk-based infrastructure investment decisions;\nStreamline and manage inspection and maintenance activities without relying on manual processes and paper records;\nMonitor and optimize maintenance performance; and\nUse advanced data analytics to identify asset failure and other safety risks which present a fire danger, such as the identification of specific equipment types or materials that are causing a higher than acceptable number of safety incidents.\nEmerging Advanced Analytics Technologies\n\nFuture opportunities may exist for LADWP to use artificial intelligence and other advanced analytics tools to leverage data and predict potential failures before they cause a wildfire, or other public safety incident. Artificial intelligence is generally defined as technology which can learn from its analytical actions in order to draw conclusions and identify patterns. This is usually enabled by automation which can efficiently process, and run calculations on, large amounts of data.\n\nAn example of one such application is waveform analytics. Waveform analytics is an emerging technology where pattern recognition tools analyze electrical waveform data from a utility’s power system in order to detect potential problems, and based on the waveform, predict the cause of the problem. This tool allows utilities to then take informed, proactive hazard mitigation actions in order to address potential safety and reliability issues.\n\nCalifornia’s IOUs are already implementing advanced analytics technologies which will enhance their ability to correlate data, identify and predict safety risks, and develop actionable safety strategies. For example, SCE has proposed implementing an artificial intelligence and predictive modeling program which will analyze real time grid data in order to identify early warning signs for potential faults. Similarly, SDG&E has plans to data mine its vegetation management information systems and use artificial intelligence tools to correlate vegetation and metrological information. This analysis will help SDG&E program managers identify the highest risk areas, and will provide them with a more detailed understanding of how atmospheric conditions impact tree growth rates.\n\nFunding for Future Wildfire Mitigation Investments\n\nLADWP, as a propriety department of the City, generates its own revenue from customers paying for water and power services. As authorized by Section 676 of the City Charter, price rates for LADWP’s power services are periodically adjusted to reflect changes in operating costs, investments to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, and costs associated with regulatory and legal mandates. Changes in power rates are proposed by the Board of Water and Power Commissioners in a Power System Rate Proposal. The Power System Rate Proposal is subject to the approval of the City Council and Mayor.\n\nIt is important to recognize that there will be costs associated with future wildfire mitigation activities undertaken by LADWP. Some of the recommendations discussed in this report, such as improving the collection and reporting of fire ignition data, and joint risk assessments with LAFD, can be accomplished with minimal additional costs. However, larger strategic initiatives, such as the implementation of EAM systems and advanced predictive analytics tools, would require significant investments by the department.\n\nLADWP must ensure that it has the resources necessary to implement a comprehensive wildfire mitigation strategy, including resources which will allow the department to eliminate current and future maintenance backlogs in high fire risk areas. To that end, the department should consider the costs of wildfire safety initiatives in its next Power System Rate Proposal. The incorporation of wildfire safety costs into its next rate proposal would help LADWP cover the expenses associated with making the power system safer, and improve the department’s ability to reliably deliver electricity to its customers.\n\nRecommendations\n\n7: LADWP should integrate dedicated wildfire prevention and safety staff to support ongoing wildfire risk assessment and planning activities, such as the identification of emerging hardware risks, and analysis of whether power lines should be undergrounded in the highest risk areas.\n\n8: To enhance accountability and provide wildfire risk insights to LADWP leadership and City policymakers, the department should, on a regular basis, report to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners a detailed record of fire incidents involving LADWP equipment. The reports should also be referred to relevant City Council committees for review.\n\n9: LADWP should deploy remote monitoring tools in high fire risk areas, such as HD cameras and weather stations, in order to improve situational awareness and the ability to respond to fire incidents.\n\n10: LADWP should evaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing an integrated enterprise asset management system for power assets.\n\n11: LADWP should evaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing advanced predictive analytics and artificial intelligence programs capable of helping the department detect and mitigate wildfire safety and asset reliability issues.\n\n12: In its next Power System Rate Proposal, LADWP should specifically incorporate costs associated with wildfire safety initiatives to ensure the department has sufficient resources to make necessary infrastructure and information systems upgrades.\n\n \n\n[21] San Diego Gas and Electric Company Wildfire Mitigation Plan, February 2019. “Richie Veihl: From Firefighter/EMT to SDG&E Fire Coordinator.” SDG&E News.

A major wildfire caused by LADWP equipment could threaten public safety and cause significant financial losses for the department. By taking steps to aggressively identify and address fire dangers, and modernizing its approach to analyzing its infrastructure and associated fire risks, LADWP can be better prepared to confront the growing wildfire threat.\n\nSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS\nNumber\tRecommendation\tResponsible Entity\nCovering Financial Losses Following Wildfires\n1\tLADWP should, in conjunction with peer utilities within the State, formally assess the legal and financial feasibility of establishing a wildfire insurance fund for publicly-owned utilities.\t    LADWP\nLADWP’s Inspection and Maintenance Activities\n2\tIn high fire threat areas, LADWP should work aggressively to eliminate maintenance backlogs so that those backlogs do not compound, and ensure the department can continue to manage workloads in high risk areas.  \t    LADWP\n3\tLADWP should enhance its maintenance inspections in high fire threat zones.  Enhancements could include, but should not be limited to, the following:\n\n(1) Inspection intervals of less than five years for detail inspection;\n\n(2) The use of drone technology to improve inspectors’ ability to evaluate equipment on top of utility poles; and\n\n(3) Inspection intervals of less than four years for hot spot-detecting infrared inspections.\n\n\t    LADWP\n4\tLADWP should establish a joint risk assessment and inspection initiative with LAFD to supplement LADWP’s evaluation of vegetation and other risk factors within high fire threat zones.\t    LADWP\n5\tIn wildfire risk zones, LADWP should expand its use of LiDAR, or other spatial analysis technologies, to supplement vegetation management patrols of power lines and improve the department’s ability to evaluate vegetation risks.\t    LADWP\n6\tLADWP should evaluate the feasibility and costs of implementing a GIS-based inventory and workflow management system for its vegetation management program in order to improve efficiency, and improve the department’s ability to detect and analyze vegetation risks.\t    LADWP\nStrategic Planning and Investments\n7\tLADWP should integrate dedicated wildfire prevention and safety staff to support ongoing wildfire risk assessment and planning activities, such as the identification of emerging hardware risks, and analysis of whether power lines should be undergrounded in the highest risk areas.\t    LADWP\n8\tTo enhance accountability and provide wildfire risk insights to LADWP leadership and City policymakers, the department should, on a regular basis, report to the Board of Water and Power Commissioners a detailed record of fire incidents involving LADWP equipment.

The City spends most of its budget compensating its workforce — in the form of salary or hourly pay, benefits and overtime — for the community resources they provide. My latest review takes a look at recent City employee overtime trends, including the impact on payroll costs, the level of usage in each department and high overtime tallies for individual employees. It also offers recommendations to help the City use data to better control spending and enhance employee safety. The review covers sworn and civilian City employees in all departments except the Department of Water and Power, which uses a separate payroll system.\n\nREAD MORE\nSummary\n\nThe City of Los Angeles, excluding Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), had more than 53,600 employees during fiscal year 2018-2019. Total payroll was $4.3 billion of which 10.9% or $470 million was overtime earned and paid. Overtime is a valuable tool and must be properly managed and monitored. A total of 8.59 million hours of overtime was recorded in FY ‘18-19 were, of which 83% was earned and paid, 6% was earned as compensated time, and 11% was primarily for lump sum payouts at retirement or year end.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nIntroduction to the City’s Payroll Practices\n\nThe City’s civil service system is established by Article X of the City Charter, and is overseen by a five-member Board of Civil Service Commissioners. The Commission established classifications for all positions of employment, which constitute the classified civil service of the City. The City also has a limited number of non-civil service employees that are considered “at will”; as of June 2019, there were 2,189 employees exempt from civil service.\n\nREAD MORE\nOverview of Citywide Overtime Earned and Paid\n\nCity departments, excluding LADWP, paid employees $2.05 billion in overtime over the past five fiscal years, beginning July 1, 2014 and ending June 30, 2019[2]. As presented in Exhibit 2, overtime payments have increased $110.6 million from FY ‘14-15 to FY ‘18-19.\n\nREAD MORE\nAnalysis of the Top 5 Departments by Overtime Earned and Paid\n\nAs shown below in Exhibit 13, the five highest overtime departments for FY ‘18-19 were LAFD, LAPD, LAWA, Sanitation, and Transportation. These five departments accounted for 90% of overtime dollars spent citywide in FY 2019.\n\nREAD MORE\nRecommendations\nDepartment General Managers should make better use of existing open data and analytical tools such as dashboards, etc., to monitor and benchmark overtime usage by office, section, and/or unit within the Department; evaluate strategies such as analyzing the cost/benefit of hiring additional employees and/or exploring other employment models to reduce the need for employees to work overtime and thereby reduce fatigue and safety concerns. (Responsible Entity: Department General Managers)\nDepartment General Managers should monitor high overtime use by individual employees to ensure overtime payments are accurate and authorized, as well as to take into consideration the potential impact of employee fatigue and safety when working extended hours. (Responsible Entity: Department General Managers)\nCity Policymakers should explore overtime control strategies that have been implemented in other cities, such as cross-training employees and limiting employees from working more than a certain number of overtime hours per shift/annually, and evaluate how those approaches can be successfully adapted within the context of existing and future labor agreements. (Responsible Entity: City Policymakers)"

HHH funds can also be used to support new affordable housing units, temporary shelters and service facilities. The ballot language of HHH provides that the City Controller shall conduct a financial audit of the program each year bonds are outstanding or proceeds remain unspent. The attached audit and review examine how the City is delivering on HHH to alleviate the most pressing issue facing Los Angeles.\n\nREAD MORE\nClick Here to View Map of Proposition HHH Projects.\nExecutive Summary\n\nTens of thousands of people spend each night in Los Angeles living on the streets, in temporary shelters, or in parked vehicles. Recently published data shows the crisis is becoming increasingly tragic throughout the region – more than 1,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County will likely die this year. The City, County, and service providers have sought to address the homelessness crisis through a combination of strategies, including street outreach and placement in temporary shelters or supportive housing – but it has been a particularly difficult challenge.\n\nREAD MORE\nProposition HHH Results to Date\n\nThe homelessness crisis in Los Angeles continues despite the City’s efforts to combat the issue. In January 2019, the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority’s (LAHSA) estimated that there are 36,300 people experiencing homelessness in the City, which represents a 41 percent increase from LAHSA’s 2015 estimate.\n\nA broad coalition of Angelenos voted to approve Proposition HHH in November 2016. Proposition HHH authorized the City to issue up to $1.2 billion in general obligation bonds to partially subsidize the development of up to 10,000 supportive housing units for individuals and families who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of becoming homeless.Supportive housing combines affordable housing with services to assist residents, such as mental and physical health services, education and job training, and drug and alcohol treatment.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nProposition HHH Status (October 2019)\n\nAs of September 30, 2019, the City has allocated nearly the entire amount authorized by the Proposition HHH ballot measure. There are additional projects seeking conditional funding which, if approved, will commit all remaining Proposition HHH funds.[15]\n\nThe City’s stated goal for the number of units to be built using Proposition HHH funds lacks clarity. Although a specific number of units did not appear in the language of the ballot measure, the development of 10,000 supportive housing units through Proposition HHH is generally understood as the target and appears on the Mayor’s website and City Council documents.[16]\n\nREAD MORE\nCost of Proposition HHH Housing Developments\n\nProposition HHH funds represent approximately 30 percent of the aggregate total development cost across projects that have been approved by the City. On a per unit basis, the maximum allowable Proposition HHH subsidy for supportive housing was $140,000 per unit during the most recent funding cycle and $220,000 per unit for previous funding cycles. Although the City is not fully subsidizing each project, significant amounts of funding come from private sources or other government entities.\n\nThese resources are finite; it is critical that the City and developers minimize development costs in order to build as many housing units as possible.\n\nThe City’s Comprehensive Homelessness Strategy (January 2016) estimated that the cost of building each studio/one-bedroom supportive housing unit would be $350,000 and a two-bedroom unit or larger would cost $414,000.[21] While construction costs have increased across-the-board since these estimates were developed, the current costs far exceed the original projections.\n\nREAD MORE\nTimelines for Proposition HHH Housing Developments\n\nLike most business endeavors, time is money when it comes to property development.  HCIDLA estimates that the timeline for completing a Proposition HHH project from start to finish (i.e., conceptualization to occupancy) ranges from three to six years. The length of time needed to complete these projects does not meet the level of urgency needed to match the magnitude of our homelessness crisis.\n\nREAD MORE\nStrategies to Reduce Costs and Expedite Timelines for Proposition HHH Housing Developments\n\nEffectively implementing a program of this magnitude requires extensive planning and the ability to pause and, if necessary, pivot to a different approach before the available funding is depleted. All viable alternatives need to be weighed against the growing urgency of our homelessness crisis.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nProposition HHH Financial Audit\n\nProposition HHH tasks the Controller’s Office with performing financial audits for every year in which bonds are outstanding, or any bond proceeds remain unspent. The financial audit for FY2018 did not identify any significant irregularities or improprieties; however, there are two specific issues that needed to be resolved.\n\nREAD MORE\nAppendix A\n\nFiscal Year 2018 financial audit.\n\nREAD MORE\nAppendix B\n\nList of Proposition HHH housing developments.\n\nREAD MORE\nEndnotes\n\n[1] Proposition HHH tasked the Controller’s Office with performing financial audits for every year in which bonds are outstanding, or any bond proceeds remain unspent. Appendix A includes a copy of the financial audit that was conducted by Macias, Gini & O’Connell. The audit covers FY2018, which was the first year a Proposition HHH bond was issued. Financial audits will be conducted for subsequent fiscal years, as required.\n\nREAD MORE"

LAWA Accounting Operations staff administer a Procurement Card (P-Card) Program that allows airport staff to directly purchase items and services to satisfy a variety of operational needs and administrative functions.\n\nThe Office of the City Controller conducts periodic reviews of P-Card expenditures at City departments to assess whether related funds are authorized, reasonable, and adequately supported.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFact #1: LAWA staff spent $7 million through P-Card transactions over the past three years (2016 – 2018).\n\nFact #2: Thirty-four percent of LAWA P-Card transactions were made at Office Depot, Home Depot, and Amazon.\n\nFact #3: Office supplies, maintenance materials & parts, and IT peripherals were commonly purchased through LAWA’s P-Card program.\n\nFact #4: LAWA accounting staff manually reviewed over 16,000 P-Card transactions in three years (2016-2018).\n\nFact #5: LAWA accounting staff manually reviewed over 16,000 P-Card transactions in three years (2016-2018).\n\nReview Results\n\nDuring our review of P-Card purchases made from January 2016 through December 2018, significant policy and procedure updates were informally implemented by LAWA accounting staff. An updated policy manual was approved by LAWA management in March 2019; granting additional authority to accounting staff for the approval of temporary P-Card limit increases up to $20,000 and providing additional documentation and approval requirements for purchases of non-standard items such as food, gift cards, and promotional items.\n\nAdministrative flexibility in P-Card policy allowed LAWA facilities and maintenance staff to rely on P-Cards for operational needs when supply contracts expired. In addition, we noted significant use of P-Cards for online transactions. Finally, the current policy allowed staff to rely on PCards for special purchases that would have been prohibited unless individual exceptions were pre-approved by LAWA management.\n\nConsidering the unique business needs related to airport operations, our Review provides several recommendations for LAWA management to improve P-Card compliance and enhance department operations. Specifically, LAWA management should:\n\nProactively monitor and assess contract expirations for all operationally critical supply contracts to ensure continuity of standard purchasing practices.\nEvaluate the business need for online transactions facilitated through P-Cards, and establish additional controls to monitor P-Card purchases facilitated through third-party payment processors such as PayPal, Square, and Intuit.\nEnsure exemption approvals of typically prohibited electronic and personal item purchases have the appropriate level of management level approval and are adequately safeguarded.\nImplement an automated system for processing and approval of PCard purchases and program applications.\n\n "

Among these properties, the City owns a vast array of real estate assets such as: commercial, residential, and industrial properties; parks; municipal facilities; police and fire stations; and even vacant land. While many of these City-owned parcels have preexisting uses, a significant number of those properties that are underutilized present a tremendous economic opportunity for the City to realize greater value from its real estate assets.\n\nREAD MORE\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Council, subject to the concurrence of the Mayor:\n\n1. Instruct the City Administrative Officer (CAO) and the Chief Legislative Analyst (CLA) to report with a proposal to create the Los Angeles Municipal Development Corporation (LAMDC) to manage the City’s real estate portfolio and leverage certain economic development financing tools, incorporating the following details:\n\nREAD MORE\nSummary\n\nFor more than 20 years, numerous studies, audits, and reports have been issued in an effort to maximize the value of the City’s real estate portfolio. Recently, the progress of an updated system of portfolio management has accelerated over the last several years. In October 2016, after calls for a consolidated, accurate, and accessible database of the City’s real estate portfolio, our Office released PropertyPanel.LA, a public-facing map detailing all of the City’s real estate assets. The most comprehensive map of City-owned properties, PropertyPanel.LA provides vital information for the City to begin to realize the value of its real estate holdings. Also, the Mayor’s Office and the Department of General Services, in August 2017, launched an internal database with a public-facing portal of the City’s real estate assets that consolidates data from various lists of City-owned property.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nThe following outlines the history of the City’s efforts to improve its real estate asset management functions and highlights the Council files, audits, reports, and miscellaneous documents pertaining to these efforts:\n\nREAD MORE\nAnalysis\n\nAmong the various recommendations set forth by the Controller’s Office, City staff, and consultants for the City’s real estate asset management and economic development, some have been adopted. After the City Administrative Officer (CAO) and the Chief Legislative Analyst (CLA) first issued their report in April 2012 recommending the new model for economic development, the CAO recommended establishing an interim entity called the Asset Management Strategic Planning unit (AMSP) in September 2012. Council adopted this recommendation and authorized the establishment of the CAO AMSP in December 2012. Soon thereafter, the CAO and CLA followed up in January 2013 with its initial recommendation to establish a joint economic development model consisting of a City department and a nonprofit corporation. Council responded by adopting the first component of this recommendation and established the Economic and Workforce Development Department (EWDD) in April 2013. However, the second part of the CAO and CLA’s recommendation—the creation of a nonprofit corporation—was not acted upon, and the council file expired in July 2016. The analysis that follows details the unique features and advantages of the Los Angeles Municipal Development Corporation (LAMDC), and examines a number of models found in other municipalities.\n\nREAD MORE\nCitywide Asset Management Timeline – Attachment A"

      "textofpage": "Compliance Review: Los Angeles Fire Department IT Commodity Procurement\nBackground\n\nAn effective and efficient information technology (IT) procurement process is critical for the City of Los Angeles (City) to leverage technology to conduct business and serve the public.  City departments must have appropriate and effective fiscal controls to prevent IT commodity contract misuse (e.g., paying for commodities that are not operationally necessary).\n\nThe Office of the City Controller conducts periodic IT commodity procurement reviews to assess how well City departments, such as LAFD, are monitoring IT commodity purchases.\n\n \n\nKey Facts\n\nFact #1: The LAFD is the City’s first responder for medical emergencies, fires and other natural disasters, responding to an average of 330,000 medical emergency calls annually. The LAFD transports more than 500 people every day to local hospitals.\n\nFact #2: LAFD’s Fiscal Year 2019 adopted budget is just over $674 million, with $662 million (98%) funded by the City’s General Fund.\n\nFact #3: Approximately 84% ($565 million) of LAFD’s Fiscal Year 2019 adopted budget is devoted to three programs, Fire Suppression, Fire Prevention, and Emergency Medical Services.\n\nFact #4: Between July 2017 and February 2019, LAFD purchased over $3.3 million in computer hardware and software, and $4 million in Motorola radio equipment. We estimate that LAFD has over 11,000 mobile radios that are installed in LAFD equipment and have a total estimated cost of more than $70 million. This estimate excludes the cost of handheld radios which are either checked out or assigned to LAFD employees.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nBased upon a sample of the LAFD’s IT commodity purchases, certain enhancements to its policies and procedures are necessary. Specifically:\n\nWritten procedures and segregation of duties are necessary:\n\nLAFD does not have written procedures documenting its procurement process for IT purchases, nor do they have proper segregation of duties over its purchasing function. There were procurement transactions showing instances where the same individual processed purchase orders, verified that the items were received and accepted the commodities in the City’s Financial Management System. This same individual also physically distributed the commodities. Additionally, some purchases did not have the required signature approvals or written justifications for the expenditures.\n\nPhysical inventories need to be completed annually and enhancements to radio communication equipment inventory controls are needed:\n\nDuring our Review, we identified computer equipment that was not entered into LAFD’s inventory system. LAFD also does not have a complete inventory listing or tracking system to account for the locations and status of its extensive inventory of mobile and hand-held radios. Management acknowledged that they have not conducted a physical inventory count for its computer equipment and radio equipment for several years."

As of the end of this quarter, the FWA Unit has a total of 144 open cases.\n\nThe FWA Unit’s evaluation of the 123 cases received between April and June 2019 determined that 31 (25 percent) were outside FWA Unit’s jurisdiction did not merit any further action.[1] Of the remaining cases, the FWA Unit referred 18 cases to other City departments or agencies for appropriate action.[2] Seventy-four cases were determined to require an investigation or additional review of which the FWA Unit referred 40 cases to the respective department; the FWA Unit retained the remaining 34 cases for investigation or additional review.\n\nAs of the end of this quarter, the FWA Unit closed a total of 70 cases. Thirty-four cases were outside FWA Unit’s jurisdiction and did not merit any further action, 19 cases were non-FWA investigative matters requiring department action, and 17 cases were investigated or reviewed. Of the 17 closed cases investigated or reviewed, 3 cases substantiated the allegations while 14 were found to be unsubstantiated.\n\n \n\nEXAMPLES OF CASES CLOSED THIS QUARTER\nFalsified Documents and Time Fraud – Resulted in the resignation of the employee. Referred to Ethics Commission that may result in additional disciplinary outcomes of the former employee.\nTheft of Time – The investigation resulted in policy changes made within the department.\nMisuse of Authority or Position – The department took remedial action to reassign the employee’s oversight of the area of concern raised in the FWA case.\nWaste of Resources and Safety Issues – The department will provide additional training. Theft of time was the leading type of issue reported for cases received during the quarter, which accounted for 13 of the 74 cases determined to require an investigation or additional review.\n\nThe breakdown of cases requiring investigation or review by departments and the number of cases referred to departments for action are as follows:\n\n \n\nFWA METRICS\n\nThis quarter, the majority of cases reported were anonymous. Most cases received were through the Controller’s Fraud Hotline through the web intake form or hotline phone calls. A small number of additional cases received were via email, U.S. mail, or in-person.\n\nThis quarter, the FWA Unit received 123 cases, compared to 132 cases in the prior quarter. The FWA Unit has received 255 cases for the first six months of the year compared to 159 cases for the first six months in the prior year, an increase of 60%. The Fraud Awareness Training deployed to all City departments, and offices in January 2019 has attributed to an increase in reported cases.\n\n \n\nFWA GOALS AND INITIATIVES UPDATE\n\nThe FWA Unit has focused our goals and initiatives into two key areas:\n\n“Prevention Centered” FWA Team\n\nFWA Investigators have met with nearly each City department general Manager and/or FWA Liaison to develop an individualized plan for each department to increase employee awareness of FWA.\nFWA is actively working to develop new marketing materials and increase the visibility of FWA. Upcoming in-person FWA information sessions coordinated are with new employee training across different departments.\n\nData Intelligence\n\nFWA is assisting the Fiscal Monitoring unit, in an upcoming Citywide data analysis report."

They are our future teachers, engineers, medical workers, public servants and entrepreneurs, but the road to success can be fraught with challenges and even peril. Too many Los Angeles youth live in poverty; thousands are homeless; some have been impacted by violence; and others are new to the country. Whatever difficulties they encounter in their formative years, scholarship on the topic shows that assisting youth in making purposeful connections with the community around them enriches their lives and influences their future.\n\nREAD MORE\nClick Here to View Map of Youth Programs in L.A.\nExecutive Summary\n\nApproximately 1.3 million Angelenos – or nearly one-third of the City’s population – are children, teens, and young adults who are 24 years old or younger. Our young people deserve access to resources that prepare them to lead healthy and fulfilling lives, and Los Angeles is home to world-class institutions offering many learning and development opportunities. Actively participating in safe and enriching programs can help improve self-confidence, increase academic achievement, and promote feelings of safety and belonging.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nApproximately 1.3 million Angelenos – nearly one-third of the City’s population – are 24 years old or younger.[1] Young people are essential members of our communities, and will play an integral role in ensuring Los Angeles remains a vibrant cultural and economic center.\n\nREAD MORE\nThe Foundation for Youth Success\n\nWhen a young person is engaged with their school, sports team, civic organization, or workplace, it can lead to improved self-confidence, improve their chances of academic success, protect against aggressive behavior, and promote feelings of safety and belonging.[2]  Young people who are actively engaged are also more likely to become healthy, productive adults, while those who feel disconnected from their communities can face development struggles and are more susceptible to negative influences like gangs.\n\nREAD MORE\nA Challenging Landscape for Some Young Angelenos\n\nLos Angeles is home to world-class museums, universities, and leading research institutions in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.  It is a global hub for the arts and media industries, and hosts some of the world’s most innovative companies.  However, not every young person can easily connect with this diverse landscape of opportunities.\n\nREAD MORE\nThe City’s Investments in Youth Programs\n\nCity departments offer a variety of programs and services to young people of all ages.  In March 2019, the City Administrative Officer and Chief Legislative Analyst, at the direction of the City Council, completed and published the results of a comprehensive survey of City departments which collected information about the youth programs they offer, program costs, and sources of funding for those programs.\n\nREAD MORE\nA Closer Look at Where the City Focuses Its Youth Spending\n\nWhen considering the City’s spending in relation to the foundational elements for successful youth development, the City dedicated the most resources ($72 million) to programs that work toward ensuring young people grow up in a safe and secure environment.  These types of programs include gang reduction programs, school safety programs, and programs that help young people secure stable housing.\n\nREAD MORE\nThe City Lacks a Comprehensive Strategy to Guide Its Youth Spending\n\nThe City does not currently have a department or commission to serve as a citywide strategy manager for youth programs.  The lack of a centralized framework means that there is no single office tasked with carrying out important initiatives such as establishing citywide youth development goals, monitoring the City’s youth programming outcomes, evaluating programming to ensure the efficient service delivery, and improving service equity and inclusion across the City.  In addition, the lack of centralized framework makes it difficult to quickly identify and resolve service gaps or redundancies.\n\nREAD MORE\nLessons from Other Jurisdictions\n\nThe administration of youth programs and services by other large jurisdictions offer lessons on alternate program management and evaluation approaches that could serve as a model for the City of Los Angeles.  New York, San Francisco, and Seattle have all been identified by youth subject matter experts as having well-developed youth program systems in cities which, like Los Angeles, serve communities which are both diverse and complex.[i]  All three cities have an organization dedicated to youth program and strategy management.  They also provide insights as to how other cities analyze community needs in order to make investment decisions.\n\nREAD MORE\nA Roadmap for Maximizing Investments in Young Angelenos\n\nAfter nearly a decade without a citywide youth development strategy or a dedicated office or commission to guide the management of youth programming, it is critically important that the City refocus its efforts to ensure all children and young adults have equal access to enriching youth development programs.  A comprehensive, data-informed strategy is necessary to ensure the existence of a youth program ecosystem covering all young people, in every corner of Los Angeles.\n\nREAD MORE\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe would like to thank the staff and subject matter experts at the following organizations for their assistance with this review:\n\nREAD MORE\nEndnotes\nREAD MORE"

Cervantes, General Manager Housing and Community Investment Department Los Angeles\nFROM: Bob Wingenroth, Director of Auditing\nOffice of the Controller – Audit Services Division\n\n\nSUBJECT: IT COMMODITY PROCUREMENT REVIEW\n\nThe Office of the Controller conducted a review of Information Technology (IT) commodity procurement at the Housing and Community Investment Department Los Angeles (HCIDLA) to ensure its IT commodity purchases are authorized, reasonable, and properly supported.\n\nWhile management of each City department is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining its internal controls to provide reasonable assurance all IT commodity purchases are authorized, supported, and comply with established policies and regulations, the Office of the Controller assists management by performing periodic reviews of the effectiveness of these departmental internal controls. These reviews compliment, but do not in any way replace, management’s assurance responsibilities.\n\nOur review identified a few opportunities where HCIDLA can enhance its internal controls related to IT commodity purchases, as detailed in the attached report.\n\nWe thank your management and staff for their cooperation and assistance during this review.\n\nBackground\n\nAn effective and efficient information technology (IT) procurement process is critical for the City of Los Angeles (City) to leverage technology to better serve Angelenos. City departments must have appropriate and effective fiscal controls to assure we are getting the best prices and commodity contracts are used only for intended purposes.\n\nThe Office of the Controller conducts periodic IT commodity procurement reviews at City departments to assess whether IT commodity purchases are authorized, reasonable, and properly supported.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFact #1:  HCIDLA’s Fiscal Year 2019 adopted budget is just over $88 million, with $12.5 million (14%) funded by the City’s General Fund and $75.5 million (86%) funded by Special Funds, which includes federal and State grant funding.\n\nFact #2: HCIDLA has over 700 employees who facilitate the financing and development of housing projects, oversee social services and housing programs to assist lowincome populations and special needs, and responds to City and State housing code complaints by conducting inspections and investigations.\n\nFact #3: The City’s Purchasing Agent (General Services Department) has established 39 IT commodity contracts for City departments to purchase IT commodities (software and hardware). Between July 2017 and February 2019, HCIDLA used six of these IT commodity contracts to purchase over $2 million in IT equipment.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nWhile HCIDLA has an impressive system to order and approve commodity purchases, based upon a sample of IT commodity purchases, certain control enhancements are necessary. Specifically:\n\nGreater Separation of Duties\n\nHCIDLA should enhance its written procurement procedures to provide guidance on obtaining quotes, ordering, approving, and receiving commodity purchases. We identified IT commodity purchases in which staff from HCIDLA’s Systems Division obtained quotes, ordered the commodities, and received the commodities. These duties need to be separated and HCIDLA’s Administrative Services Division staff should be involved to ensure these specific activities are not exclusively concentrated within HCIDLA’s Systems Division.\n\nItems Purchased Before Needed\n\nHCIDLA should ensure IT commodity purchases are made when operationally necessary. We identified certain IT commodity purchases occurring long before the items were needed.\n\nBudget Transparency and Proper Approval for Reallocated Budgeted Funds\n\nWe identified that HCIDLA used its professional services budget line item to purchase IT commodities after its Office and Administrative budget line item had been exhausted. However, given the threshold of the dollar amounts involved (e.g., over $280,000), HCIDLA should have requested authority to transfer this amount to the appropriate line item through a Financial Status Report, which requires approval by the City Administrative Officer, the Mayor, and the City’s Budget and Finance Committee.\n\n "

Cervantes, General Manager Housing and Community Investment Department Los Angeles\nFROM: Bob Wingenroth, Director of Auditing\nOffice of the Controller – Audit Services Division\n\n\nSUBJECT: IT PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACTING\n\n\nThe Office of the Controller conducted a review of Information Technology (IT) commodity procurement at the Housing and Community Investment Department Los Angeles (HCIDLA) to ensure its properly monitoring the use of IT professional services contracts, related payments are authorized, reasonable, and properly supported.\n\nWhile management of each City department is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining its internal controls to provide reasonable assurance all IT professional service contract payments and purchases are authorized, reasonable, supported, and comply with established policies and regulations, the Office of the Controller assists management by performing periodic reviews of the effectiveness of these departmental internal controls. These reviews compliment, but do not in any way replace, management’s assurance responsibilities.\n\nOur review identified a few opportunities where HCIDLA can enhance its internal controls related to monitoring the use of IT professional service contracts, as detailed in the attached report.\n\nWe thank your management and staff for their cooperation and assistance during this review.\n\nBackground\n\nCity of Los Angeles (City) departments use various Information Technology (IT) professional service contracts for unique, scientific, expert, or technical services of a temporary nature because the City’s Information Technology Agency does not have all the resources or specialized services required by City Departments and the need for IT services can fluctuate greatly from year to year.\n\nThe Office of the City Controller conducts periodic IT professional services contracting reviews to assess how well City departments, such as HCIDLA, are doing monitoring the use of IT professional service contracts, ensuring the related payments are authorized, reasonable, and properly supported.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFact #1: HCIDLA’s Fiscal Year 2019 adopted budget is just over $88 million, with $12.5 million (14%) funded by the City’s General Fund and $75.5 million (86%) funded by Special Funds, which includes federal and State grant funding.\n\nFact #2: HCIDLA has over 700 employees who facilitate the financing and development of housing projects, oversee social services and housing programs to assist lowincome populations and special needs, and responds to City and State housing code complaints by conducting inspections and investigations.\n\nFact #3: HCIDLA’s Fiscal Year 2019 adopted budget for Contractual Services was $15.4 million, a portion of which is dedicated for IT professional services.\n\nFact #4: Between July 2017 and February 2019, HCIDLA has paid one contractor $2.8 million for IT professional services.\n\nFact #5: In Fiscal Year 2016, the capitalization threshold for reporting new software acquired/developed decreased $250,000 or more to $5,000 or more.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nWhile HCIDLA frequently meets with IT contracted staff on planned system/application upgrades or development, based upon a sample of IT professional service payments and interviews, certain control enhancements are necessary. Specifically:\n\nTransition plans should be developed to have HCIDLA employees trained to support and maintain systems/applications that have been implemented and to reduce an over reliance on professional service contractors to provide ongoing support and maintenance of a permanent nature.\nFormal performance metrics should be used to monitor the timeliness and associated costs of system/application upgrades.\nDocumentation of IT contracted staff selections is needed to demonstrate that the selections had been made in a fair and objective manner, with the most qualified contracted staff being selected. Moreover, IT contracted staff working with sensitive or confidential information should undergo a background check.\nTracking of new IT software development costs requires enhancement to ensure the Office of the City Controller is provided with accurate and complete information on software development costs for capitalization and reporting within the City’s financial statements.\n\n "

The uptick in complaints during the quarter may be attributed to the enhanced Fraud Awareness Training deployed to all City departments and Offices in January 2019.\n\nEXAMPLES OF CASES CLOSED THIS QUARTER\n\nThe following list highlights several key cases which closed during the quarter ending March 31, 2019 for fraud, waste and abuse related reviews, and investigations conducted by or in collaboration with the FWA Unit:\n\nFalsified documents and time fraud\nTheft of time\nConflict of time\nGifts from outside sources and conflicts of interest\nWorkers’ Compensation fraud\nMisuse of authority or position \n\n \n\nFWA Unit Activity\n\nThe FWA Unit’s evaluation of the 132 complaints received during January to March 2019 determined that 53 (40%) did not merit any further action.  Examples of cases that did not merit any further action were those with insufficient information to investigate and cases that were not within the City’s jurisdiction.  Of the remaining 79 complaints, FWA referred 35 (27%) complaints to other City departments or agencies for appropriate action, while 31 (23%) complaints were determined to require an investigation or additional review.  Of the 31 complaints identified for investigation or additional review, the FWA Unit referred 25 complaints to the respective department, while an additional six complaints were retained by the FWA Unit for its investigation or review.\n\nAs of April 17, 2019, the FWA Unit closed a total of 22 complaints which had been identified for investigation or additional review. Of the 22 closed complaints, 3 had been received during the current quarter and 19 were from prior periods. Currently there are 78 open cases which were determined to require an investigation or additional review.\n\nTheft of time was the leading type of issue reported for complaints received during the quarter which accounted for 12 (39%) of the 31 complaints determined to require an investigation or additional review.\n\nThe breakdown of complaints requiring investigation or review by department is as follows:\n\nFWA Goals and Initiatives\n\n\nThe FWA Unit has focused our goals and initiatives for FY2019 into two key areas:\n\n“Prevention Centered” FWA Team\n\nFWA investigators have met with 15 City department General Managers and/or FWA liaisons to develop an individualized plan for each department to increase employee awareness of FWA.\nFWA is actively working to develop new marketing materials and increase visibility of FWA through posters, brochures, social media, Channel 35 and fraud awareness week.\nFWA is currently collaborating with the Ethics Commission on conducting joint investigations in cases were both departments have jurisdiction.\n\nData Intelligence\n\nFWA Unit will perform a proactive data analytic driven review of PaySR and FMS data. The analysis methodology is in the development stage and will leverage information from internal audit reviews to focus on higher risk areas."

While bad behavior is not the norm for City employees or contractors, it does happen on occasion, which can hurt the City’s coffers and undermine public trust in government.

About seven years ago, Building and Safety instituted a different process for Technology Services purchase requisitions (also referred to as S1Bs), limiting the role of Resource Management in the procurement of Technology purchases to verifying the availability of funds. Beginning in 2012, Technology Services, for the most part, obtained quotes and purchased good and services independently of Resource Management.\n\nREAD MORE\nRecommendation Summary\nREAD MORE"

When viewed from above, it offers a swirling vision of freeways, streets and sidewalks, along with buildings, green hillsides, parks and millions of trees that make up our urban forest. Although they come in many shapes, sizes and species, trees provide myriad benefits to the City and the people who live here.\n\nREAD MORE\nExecutive Summary\n\nA vibrant and well-maintained urban forest provides significant environmental, social, and economic benefits that improve quality of life for residents. Multiple City departments are responsible for maintaining trees under the care and control of the City: Board of Public Works Bureau of Street Services/Urban Forestry Division (Public Works); Department of Water and Power (DWP); and Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP). Collectively, these departments spent approximately $49 million on tree maintenance activities in FY2017-18.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nAll publicly and privately owned trees within an urban environment comprise what is typically referred to as an urban forest. A vibrant and well-maintained urban forest can provide significant environmental, social, and economic benefits that improve quality of life for Angelenos.\n\nREAD MORE\nConducting a Citywide Inventory of Street Trees\n\nStreet trees, like roadways and sidewalks, are an element of the City’s public works infrastructure, and require ongoing planning, maintenance, and improvements. To effectively carry out these tasks, Public Works needs reliable data to make strategic decisions about the street tree population.\n\nREAD MORE\nUsing Data to Improve Street Tree Maintenance\n\nMaintenance of street trees, like other public infrastructure assets which require ongoing maintenance and monitoring, benefits from centralized tools to effectively manage how work is assigned, performed, and monitored. Reliance on paper records and fragmented processes related to data collection prevent the ability to take a comprehensive, data-driven approach to caring for street trees.\n\nREAD MORE\nPotential Contracting Strategies to Meet Future Needs\n\nOver the last three years, the City primarily used contractors for proactive street tree trimming services. Although Public Works is shifting to an in-house approach, future conditions may require a temporary or targeted surge in contracted services to strategically supplement the work performed by in-house crews.\n\nREAD MORE\nScope & Methodology\n\nThe objective of our review was to identify areas of opportunity where the City can improve its street tree maintenance activities.\n\nWe planned and performed the review to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our observations and conclusions based on our objectives.

Wright, General Manager Los Angeles Department of Water and Power\nFROM: Bob Wingenroth, Audit Director Office of the Controller\n\n\nSUBJECT: PAYROLL COMPLIANCE REVIEW\n\nThe Office of the Controller conducted a review of payroll at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) to ensure that LADWP bases its payroll on approved time worked (including overtime), and that any supplemental pay (i.e., bonuses, mileage reimbursements, etc.) are authorized, reasonable, and properly supported.\n\nWhile management of each City department is responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining a system to provide reasonable assurance that payroll and mileage reimbursements are authorized, supported, and comply with established policies and regulations, the Office of the Controller assists management by performing periodic reviews of the effectiveness of these departmental systems. These reviews compliment, but do not in any way replace, management’s assurance responsibilities.\n\nOur review identified a few opportunities where LADWP can enhance its internal controls to ensure payments to employees are authorized, supported, and comply with policies and regulations, as detailed in the attached report.\n\nWe thank your management and staff for their cooperation and assistance during this Review.\n\n\nBackground\n\nPayroll is the largest cost incurred by the City of Los Angeles (City). Department management must ensure employee pay is accurate and supported by appropriate authorization, especially for overtime and other additions to pay, such as bonuses for professional certifications.\n\nThe Office of the City Controller conducts periodic payroll compliance reviews to assess how well departments are following through on their responsibilities. This is especially important at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), which uniquely processes its own payroll. All other City departments (including the City’s two other proprietary departments, i.e., Airport and Harbor) process their payroll through the Office of the City Controller.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFACT #1: LADWP provides water and power utility services to more than 4 million residents across 470 square miles.\n\n\nFACT #2: LADWP resources include 23 power generating plants, 160 distributing stations, 119 water tanks and reservoirs, 96 pump stations and 7,337 miles of pipes.\n\n\nFACT #3: LADWP employs approximately 10,000 staff. For calendar year 2017 LADWP payroll totaled nearly $1.3 billion, including $190 million (15%) paid for overtime and $130 million (10%) in other additions to pay. For fiscal year 2018, LADWP’s payroll costs represent 16% of its $8 billion budget.\n\n\nFACT #4: For calendar year 2017, LADWP ranked 2nd in overtime payments among City departments, after the Fire Department but before the Police Department. Further during calendar year 2017.111 LADWP employees collected $100,000 or more in overtime payments. Another 216 employees collected between $75,000 and $100,000 in overtime.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nBased upon a small sample of employee overtime and additions to pay, the pay was supported by documentation. However, we learned that LADWP’s Internal Audit Division has not audited overtime or additions to pay for more than 10 years. LADWP is a large organization with each division establishing its own policies and procedures to control overtime and additions to pay. These disparate controls warrant a review of their effectiveness by the LADWP Internal Audit Division.\n\n\nFurther, during our Review, we noted that LADWP’s mainframe based payroll system has limitations in providing ad-hoc monitoring reports, or details on the reasons for certain types of add-on bonuses. LADWP management indicated it is in the process of evaluating potential replacement payroll systems amongst other priority projects. We highly encourage LADWP to prioritize the replacement of this mainframe-based payroll system."

But, when a critical incident occurs, some civilian City employees may be called into action to help Los Angeles as Disaster Service Workers (DSW), an unused program and the subject of my latest report.\n\nREAD MORE\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Los Angeles must be prepared for any natural or man-made catastrophe. When disaster strikes, the City’s primary emergency responders (Fire and Police) will be first at the scene to provide aid to preserve and protect life and property. The Emergency Management Department would support response efforts by coordinating activities between key City departments and regional organizations at the City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Additional relief support would be provided through designated and certified volunteer organizations, such as the American Red Cross and Salvation Army. But as relief efforts continue, the City may need to call on its employees, through the Disaster Service Worker (DSW) program, to assist in response and relief work.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nPUBLIC SERVANTS’ ROLE AS DISASTER SERVICE WORKERS\n\nWhat is a Disaster Service Worker (DSW)?\nA DSW is an individual who aids in the response and recovery phases of a disaster or emergency. Pursuant to State law, all public sector employees in California are considered DSWs, and may be called upon to serve in that capacity. Examples of general duties DSWs may perform include clerical support, answering telephones, delivering supplies, running messages, managing volunteers, staffing barricades, working in a Red Cross shelter, food preparation and serving, interpreting, and filling sandbags. The duties of a DSW differs from the work performed by employees who are charged with restoring critical City services to ensure the safety of the general populace and mission-essential functions, as identified in their departments’ Continuity of Operations Plan. Employees acting as DSWs are to be assigned within their scope of training, skill, ability and will never be expected to provide medical treatment or aid in disaster response activities for which they are not qualified. Employees whose work is not time sensitive or directly impacting City services may be needed to work outside their normal scope of duties by serving as DSWs. All DSWs are compensated for their work in accordance with established agreements between representative labor organizations and the City, including overtime.\n\nREAD MORE\nObservations & Recommendations: DSW Deployment Practices\n\nThe City does not have a database of employee contact information and skillsets to facilitate the deployment of Disaster Service Workers.\n\nThe completeness of employee contact information and how the information is collected varies by department. Despite the fact that complete and up-to-date information must be available to activate DSWs when needed, departments are not required to adopt any particular method or standard for collecting or storing employee information.\n\nREAD MORE\nObservations & Recommendations: Employee Awareness of the DSW Program\n\nThe City should better publicize the potential duties that employees may be asked to perform as DSWs.\n\nWhile the City informs employees of their mandatory participation in the DSW program, there are limited details about what tasks employees may actually perform. The Emergency Management and Personnel departments have developed an extensive “DSW Toolkit” (Toolkit), which provides some examples of the various jobs that a DSW may perform. The Toolkit is available to personnel or emergency coordination staff, but it is not shared with employees, who could benefit by knowing what to expect. Identified duties are as diverse as animal care, to food service, to language interpreter, etc.\n\nREAD MORE"

My report offers several strategies for the City’s consideration as it should both modernize and reduce the number of passenger vehicles in the fleet in the coming years.\n\nREAD MORE\nSummary\n\nThe City owns a large fleet of vehicles and equipment so employees can perform work-related functions across approximately 469 square miles. The Department of General Services (GSD) procures vehicles for all Council-controlled Departments and is responsible for fleet maintenance and repair of non-public safety vehicles. Staff from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) are responsible for maintaining vehicles assigned to their respective departments. The City’s Proprietary Departments (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Los Angeles World Airports, and Port of Los Angeles) each procure, maintain, and administer their own vehicle fleets.\n\nREAD MORE\nBackground\n\nThe City of Los Angeles (City) encompasses approximately 469 square miles, and safe and reliable transport for City employees is necessary to ensure they can perform their jobs effectively. To help meet their needs for transportation, the City procures and maintains passenger vehicles for use by employees, which are part of the City’s vehicle fleet.\n\nREAD MORE\nThe City’s Passenger Vehicle Fleet Requires Strategic Investment\n\nThe City needs a reliable, safe motor pool. Without a long-term investment strategy that addresses replacement and maintenance of passenger vehicles, the City will continue its heavy reliance on corrective maintenance. Over the past four years, GSD reported spending more than $8.3 million on direct labor and parts related to corrective maintenance for approximately 2,000 passenger vehicles.4\n\nREAD MORE\nAlternative Options for Employee Transportation\n\nIn lieu of utilizing a general pool vehicle to conduct City business, there are additional transportation options currently available to City employees:  \n\npublic transportation (e.g. LADOT/DASH Buses);  \npersonal mileage reimbursement (certified employees only); and  \ntelephone/video conferencing.\nREAD MORE\nAlternative Fleet Management Models and Technology-Based Solutions\n\nCity policymakers should also consider alternatives to leverage advances in transportation technology and potentially reduce administrative and maintenance costs related to City ownership of vehicles.\n\nREAD MORE"

Older adults comprise 19% of the City’s population and this ratio will increase to approximately 24% (nearly one in four Angelenos) by 2030. These demographic shifts will have significant societal impacts, particularly in the areas of health and wellness, nutrition, affordable housing, transportation and mobility, social interaction, civic engagement, and employment.

As outlined in the City’s Emergency Public Information Annex, the incident commander is to determine what information will be made available to the public. EMD will then coordinate emergency notifications through NotifyLA only when requested and deemed necessary by public safety officials. EMD noted that this practice can prevent unintentional interference with the emergency response operations; however, it may also inadvertently withhold critical information from the public that could be reached through the City’s NotifyLA system.\n\nREAD MORE"

Reynolds, General Manager Department of Transportation  \nFROM: Georgia Mattera, Chief Deputy Controller Office of the Controller\n\n\nSUBJECT: BANK ACCOUNTS NOT CONTROLLED BY THE OFFICE OF FINANCE\n\nThe Office of the Controller conducted a compliance review of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation’s (DOT) bank accounts not controlled by the Office of Finance. Our objective was to ensure expenditures are authorized, supported, and comply with the purposes for which these accounts were established.\n\nManagement of each City department must design, implement, and maintain a system that reasonably assures proper authorization and support for expenditures and that complies with established policies and regulations. The Office of the Controller assists management by performing periodic assessments of the effectiveness of departmental processes. These assessments complement, not replace, management’s assurance responsibilities.\n\nAfter reviewing current practices related to the Petty Cash and Bail Refund Revolving Fund Bank Accounts, we concluded DOT followed applicable policies and procedures; though we identified areas for improvement related to the Bail Refund Account. The attached report includes our observations and recommendations. Further, based on our evaluation of DOT’s response, we now consider Recommendation 1 as Implemented, and Recommendations 2 and 3 as In Progress.\n\nWe appreciate your staff’s cooperation and assistance during this review.\n\ncc: Sue Chen, Departmental Chief Accountant IV\n\nBackground\n\nSeveral Los Angeles City (City) departments have bank accounts not controlled by the Office of Finance, and detailed transactions in these accounts are not generally recorded in the City’s Financial Management System (FMS). Periodic compliance reviews of these bank accounts are necessary to assess whether departments are using them in accordance with authorized purposes and whether there are adequate internal controls and oversight.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) has two of these accounts, both maintained as revolving funds to streamline reimbursements. The City authorized DOT’s Petty Cash Fund checking account in 2010, and the current authorized balance is $2,000. The second is used for refunding parking citation bail after a DOT review deems the citation recipient “not liable.” The City created the Bail Refund Revolving Bank Account by ordinance, in 1986, with an authorized balance based on twice the amount of monthly refund checks. The balance as of June 30, 2018 was just under $216,000.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFACT #1: DOT officers issue about 2.2 million parking citations annually.\n\nFACT #2: About 4% of DOT’s parking citations issued are contested and go to review; 27% of those reviewed in FY 2018 resulted in a permanent suspension of the citation, down from 41% in 2016.\n\nFACT #3: While less than 1% of citations go to a hearing; about 25% of hearings result in a finding in favor of the contestant, whereby a refund is also due to the payor.\n\nFACT #4: Very few (approximately one-tenth of 1%) are appealed to the Superior Court; and about 68% of those appeals result in a reversal of the finding, whereby a refund is due to the payor.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nDOT’s recordkeeping and controls over these two checking accounts are in proper order. DOT reconciles book and bank balances regularly and divides custody, recordkeeping, and authorized signer duties among different staff. The transactions we reviewed accorded with the two funds’ authorized purposes.\n\nWe identified an area for improvement related to processes surrounding the Bail Refund Revolving Bank Account. DOT typically stores thousands of outstanding, uncashed checks, currently totaling well over $700,000 that were sent to claimants but returned to DOT. Accounting for thousands of outstanding checks is burdensome, and claimants who spend significant effort to obtain a refund are unaware that a refund check has been issued.\n\nWhile uncashed checks are subject to escheatment by the City after three years, DOT should make it easier for the rightful claimants to find their outstanding refund prior to the escheatment process. This would more fully address the City Council’s 2012 instruction to implement a searchable database of payee names for whom a parking violation refund was made, so individuals who are owed refunds from the City can collect their money."

      "textofpage": "Incentive Agreements: Tax Breaks and Subvention Deals\n\nDATE: August 10, 2018\n\nTO: Honorable Members of the City Council\n\nFROM: Ron Galperin, Los Angeles City Controller\n\nSUBJECT: Incentive Agreements (Tax Abatements/Subvention Agreements, CF# 15-0850-S2)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nMotion (Blumenfield – Price, CF #15-0850-S2) was previously introduced to request the City Controller to report to the Ad Hoc Committee on Comprehensive Job Creation Plan on the efficacy of the Incentive Agreements entered into by the City of Los Angeles, and to provide recommendations for the development of standards consistent with recently approved Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 77 reporting requirements. The requested report is consistent with a review for which this Office was previously preparing.\n\nIn order to examine the process for which Incentive Agreements are identified, evaluated, and approved, the Office of the City Controller reviewed five Incentive Agreements approved between 2005 and 2015. The agreements provide financial assistance to project developers totaling up to $654 million ($202 million Net Present Value (NPV)). The five projects include: the Headquarters Hotel (now a J.W. Marriott and Ritz Carlton); the Wilshire Grand Hotel (now an InterContinental); the Olympic North Hotel (now a Courtyard Marriott and Residence Inn); the Metropolis Hotel (now a Hotel Indigo); and the Village at Westfield Topanga.\n\nThe City has committed a total of up to $654 million in assistance for the aforementioned projects. Within the last 2 years, the City has further approved up to $345 million in tax Incentive Agreements, including financial support for: the Grand Avenue project ($198.4 million – CF# 13-1694); Cambria ($43.2 million – CF# 16-1128) and Pico-Figueroa Hotels ($103.3 million – CF# 16-0073). Incentives for all eight projects total up to $999 million.\n\nFurther, the City has requested evaluation of additional proposed hotel projects for consideration of Incentive Agreements, as follows: 3900 Figueroa Street (CF# 18-0367); 3240 Wilshire Boulevard (CF# 18-0238); Olive Street Hotel (CF# 18-0399); and the proposed expansion of the JW Marriott Hotel (CF# 18-0532).\n\nUsing the Block Grant Investment Fund Policy (BGIF) as a framework to evaluate the first of the five projects, the City Council approved financial assistance due to the stated existence of a “feasibility gap.” A feasibility gap, per the practice of the City, is defined as the difference between the estimated development costs of a project vs. what investors would theoretically be willing to pay for the business investment, based on the project’s expected value. The assurance of the City’s financial assistance is intended to offer an incentive for developers and investors to provide the capital needed for the projects to be developed. It has been argued that absent this incentive, certain projects would not be viable, thus the City would not otherwise realize net new revenues projected 2 as a result of said new project(s). There has not in all cases been adequate evidence to necessarily support these arguments.\n\nAs outlined in each Incentive Agreement, the City is to provide financial assistance payments to developers after the project is completed and in operation over a set period of time. During the term of an Incentive Agreement, the City’s payments represent the amount the project owner/operator actually remits to a specified taxing authority (e.g., Transient Occupancy Taxes to the City’s Office of Finance or the City’s share of property taxes paid to the County). However, the total financial assistance paid is capped at 50 percent of the anticipated cumulative net new tax revenue the City is expected to receive from all sources attributed to the project, or until a specified number of years have been reached. In addition, the City anticipates that the projects will each generate additional jobs and broader economic and other public benefits. For the Downtown hotel projects this Office reviewed, the City’s expectation was that they would also support the attraction of additional and larger scale conventions to the Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC) while increasing the number of hotel rooms within walking distance to the LACC.\n\nGiven the significant financial assistance already committed by the City for the five reviewed, and three subsequently approved projects, this report offers recommendations that are intended to provide perspective for possible future agreements. The background and analysis section provides an overview of the five Incentive Agreements reviewed, an analysis of processes used for approving and implementing the Incentive Agreements, and an update on the City’s implementation of new reporting requirements mandated by GASB 77."

To do so, it is vital that we modernize the City of L.A.’s outdated recruitment and hiring process – along with updating our Civil Service system.\n\nREAD MORE\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe City of Los Angeles has a workforce of approximately 55,000 employees, comprised of approximately 41,000 civilian staff at all operating departments (including the Department of Water and Power) and about 14,000 sworn personnel at the Police and Fire Departments. Nearly half of the civilian employees are age 50 or older, and many are eligible for retirement. The City has routine turnover and like all employers, faces challenges in a competitive job market.\n\nREAD MORE\nThe Complexity of Selecting and Hiring Employees\n\nMost of the City’s workforce is comprised of civil service employees. The civil service system was designed to hire or promote government employees based on merit rather than cronyism or nepotism. However, a number of factors can hinder the City’s ability to hire the best qualified candidates. This includes the City’s long hiring process and legal restrictions based on the interpretation of the City Charter and related civil service rules, as well as outdated job titles and minimum job qualifications that may be too narrowly defined, eliminating good candidates.\n\nREAD MORE\nBranding the City and Attracting the Best-Suited Candidates\n\nTo attract the next generation of employees, the City needs to transform how it recruits and hires new people. Research5 indicates different generational viewpoints on what is important about a career, and what attracted members of the Baby Boom and Gen X to the City no longer holds true for many Millennials and members of Generation Z. Added to that, in today’s world, technology has changed the way people search for jobs and how they think about those jobs.\n\nREAD MORE\nEngaging Employees in a Renewed Workforce\n\nConsiderable effort is dedicated to recruit employees, so it is important for the City, as it renews its workforce, to keep employees engaged by addressing their motivations and concerns. According to a survey of state and local government7, turnover is one of the highest concerns relative to workforce issues. The economy has improved, the labor pool is shrinking, and employees have other options, which emphasizes the importance of retaining and engaging employees. While much of the exodus from government organizations is due to retiring baby boomers, there is the risk of losing disengaged workers or retaining disengaged and unproductive workers.\n\nREAD MORE"

Royster, General Manager General Services Department\nFROM: Georgia Mattera, Chief Deputy Controller, Office of the Controller\nSUBJECT: COMPLIANCE REVIEW OF PURCHASING CARDS\n\n\nThe Office of the Controller completed a compliance review of the General Services Department’s (GSD) oversight of Purchasing Card (PCard) usage to ensure expenditures are authorized, supported, and comply with the City’s PCard Program Cardholder Manual (Manual).\n\nManagement of each City department must design, implement, and maintain a system that reasonably assures PCard usage is authorized, supported, and complies with the Manual. The Office of the Controller assists management by performing periodic assessments of the of this departmental system. These assessments complement, but do not in any way replace, management’s assurance responsibilities.\n\nOur review identified certain areas in which GSD can enhance its oversight to ensure PCard usage is authorized, supported, and complies with the Manual, as detailed in the attached report.\n\nBackground\n\nBackground The City of Los Angeles (City) created the Purchasing Card (PCard) Program to provide departments with an efficient, cost-effective way of routinely paying for low value items, and during disasters a quick way to make large purchases. PCards are credit cards issued to City employees. The Office of the Controller administers the PCard Program for Council-controller departments, while each department’s management choses employees to receive PCARDs, approves and reviews PCard transactions, and ensures compliance with the City’s PCard Program Cardholder Manual (Manual). The Office of the Controller completes periodic compliance reviews of PCard usage to ensure expenditures are authorized, supported, and comply with the Manual.\n\nKey Facts\n\nFACT #1: GSD provides essential support services for non-proprietary City departments, including building maintenance, custodial, fleet, fuel, mail, parking, printing, publishing, supply, procurement, inventory, mail, messenger, materials testing, and parking services.\n\nFACT #2: GSD’s $235 million budget for fiscal year 2018 included $73 million for fleet services, $45 million for fuel and environmental compliance, $32 million for building maintenance, $31 for real estate services and $21 million for custodial services.\n\nFACT #3: GSD assigned 173 PCards to its employees and they collectively spent $1.3 million with  their PCards.\n\nFACT #4: Most PCards issued to GSD employees have a $5,000 monthly limit and a $1,000 single purchase limit.\n\nCompliance Review Results\n\nCompliance Review Results We identified opportunities where GSD can enhance its oversight and ensure PCard usage by its employees is authorized, supported, and complies with the Manual, as follows:\n\nEnsure PCard holders are not using PCards to purchase items from vendors with established contracts in the City’s procurement program, as the City’s purchasing agent may have negotiated better prices.\nPeriodically remind PCard holders of prohibited purchasing practices, such as purchasing electronics.\n\nAnalyze PCard transactions to ensure PCard holders are not making split purchases to circumvent single purchase transaction limits."
